/// column…"). Lives inside `FileCellView`, right-aligned, exactly where Finder puts them.
///
/// Custom-drawn rather than text, because the content *is* the colour — which is also why this
/// doesn't borrow `FileCellView.accentColor` the way the Git letter does.
///
/// **The layout is Finder's, and it was measured rather than guessed** (a file tagged
/// `Red, Green, Blue, Yellow` was written by the system, opened in Finder, and zoomed into). Both
/// things it does are the opposite of the obvious first draft:
///
/// - **The dots run in reverse.** The **last** tag sits leftmost and fully visible; each earlier tag
///   peeks out from behind it to the right, showing only a crescent. So `[Red, Blue]` reads as a
///   whole blue dot with a red sliver on its right. It is the same precedence the core found in the
///   legacy label byte, where the *last* coloured tag wins — the newest tag is the one macOS shows.
/// - **They overlap by roughly two thirds**, so four tags cost barely more room than two.
