/// Deliberately shaped like `GitStatusProvider` — off-main, cached, rate-limited, published by
/// notification — for the same reason, which the core *measured*: one `getxattr` costs ~10 µs
/// whether the file is tagged or not, so a 100k-row directory costs ~1 s of pure attribute reads
/// against M1's 150 ms budget for opening one. That is why the column is filled from a cache
/// afterwards and never folded into `LocalBackend.listDirectory`.
///
/// **What differs from the Git provider, and why.** Its unit of caching is the *repository*,
/// because one `git status` answers for a whole tree. There is no such command for tags: the answer
/// is per file, so the unit here is the **directory**, and the caller passes the paths to read. Two
/// panes on the same folder still share one scan; a pane and its neighbour on different folders
