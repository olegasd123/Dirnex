/// mark, Shift-click extends a range. It drives the same mark set as the Total
/// Commander keyboard gestures (Space, `+`/`-`, `*`): the marked entries render in the
/// bold accent style and are what operations act on. A plain click never marks — it
/// only moves the cursor (the blue row highlight) and re-anchors the range for a later
/// Shift-click; operations still act on the cursor entry when nothing is marked.
///
/// A Cmd/Shift click is consumed here and never reaches `NSTableView`'s own
/// single-selection/drag machinery; a plain click falls through to `super.mouseDown`
/// so the cursor moves and a drag-out can still begin (see `FileTableView.mouseDown`).
/// The `mouseSelectionAnchor`/`mouseSelectionBase` state for the range sweep lives on
/// `PanelViewController`.
