/// Prompts for a remote server, connects it, and — when named — saves it to the sidebar's Servers
/// section. Two protocols share one entry point:
///
/// - **SFTP** browses through a `VFSBackend`: a throwaway transport probes the connection (resolving
///   the remote home doubles as an auth/host test), then the same config is registered on the pane's
///   `CompositeBackend` so listings route to it. Password auth feeds `sftp` via `SSH_ASKPASS`.
/// - **SMB** rides the OS mounter: `SMBMounter` mounts the share into `/Volumes/…` and the pane
///   navigates onto the resulting local path, so every M2 op works unchanged.
///
/// Secrets are filed in the Keychain only after they authenticate, so a typo isn't cached.
