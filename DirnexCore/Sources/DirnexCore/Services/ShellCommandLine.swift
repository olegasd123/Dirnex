    ///   line editor may hold a half-typed command; appending `cd …` to it and pressing Return
    ///   would execute *their* words plus ours. Someone who had typed `rm -rf /` and thought better
    ///   of it would watch us run `rm -rf / cd -- '/x'`. `^U` kills to the start of the line and
    ///   `^K` to the end; either alone is enough in `zsh`, but `bash`'s `^U` only kills *backwards*
    ///   from the cursor, so a line abandoned with the cursor in the middle needs both.
    /// - **The leading space** asks the shell to keep our synthetic command out of the user's
    ///   history (`HIST_IGNORE_SPACE` in zsh, `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` in bash). Neither is on by
    ///   default, so this is a courtesy that lands for the people who opted in, not a guarantee.
    ///   What keeps history genuinely clean is the caller: `ShellWorkingDirectory.command(toFollow:)`
    ///   emits nothing at all when the shell is already in the right place, which is the common case.
    /// - **`cd --`** ends option parsing, so a directory named `-p` is a path rather than a flag.
    ///   Panels only ever navigate to absolute paths, so this is belt-and-braces; `fish` is left
    ///   with a plain `cd` because its `cd` is a function whose `--` handling is not the shell's to
    ///   promise. (Plain `cd` also means a user's own `cd` — `zoxide`, an auto-`ls` wrapper — still
    ///   runs, which is their setup working as they configured it. `builtin cd` would be more
    ///   predictable for us and ruder to them.)
