/// Shaped like `GitStatusSnapshot`: every scan happens once at construction so `bar(for:)` is
/// O(1) per row, because a panel asks once per visible row on every render.
///
/// Three properties worth knowing, each of which a test pins:
/// - **Unknown is not zero.** A directory with no recursive walk yet has *no* bar, not a zero-width
///   one — `nil` from `bar(for:)`. A 0 % bar on an unsized 40 GB folder is a lie, and the two states
///   are visually identical if collapsed. Only `DirectoryModel.computedSize` can tell them apart.
/// - **Both denominators cover the *visible* rows only.** Hiding dotfiles or typing a filter
///   re-scales every bar, because a bar drawn relative to a row you cannot see is unexplainable,
///   and shares that silently fail to reach 100 % are worse than shares of what is on screen.
/// - **It re-scales for free while results stream in.** Sizing a directory is slow (measured: 7.5 s
///   for `~/Dev`, and cost tracks *entry count*, not bytes — a 1 TB `~/Movies` walks fast while a
///   17 GB tree of `node_modules` does not), so bars must appear progressively and the maximum
///   grows underneath them. Rebuilding this whole projection per render handles that with no
///   incremental bar-width bookkeeping; `share` is therefore a share of what is *known so far* and
///   settles as walks land.
