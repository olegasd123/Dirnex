# Dirnex — implementation plan

A dual-pane, keyboard-first file manager for macOS in the spirit of Total Commander,
built native (Swift), with macOS-only superpowers TC never had: Quick Look, Spotlight
search, APFS clones, Finder tags, a command palette, and universal undo.

Status: planning · Created: 2026-07-05

---

## 1. Product goals

**Must be true at 1.0:**

- Fully operable without a mouse. Tab switches panels, typing filters, F-keys drive
  operations, selection is independent of the cursor.
- File operations never block the UI. Everything runs through a background queue with
  progress, pause/resume, and conflict resolution.
- Feels native: Quick Look, Trash, drag-and-drop, dark mode, Finder tags, share sheet.
- Fast on ugly inputs: a 100k-entry directory opens and scrolls without jank.
- Undo works for file operations, not just text fields.

**Non-goals (for 1.0):**

- Windows/Linux ports.
- App Store distribution (sandbox is incompatible with a real file manager).
- An open binary plugin API (revisit post-1.0; automation hooks cover most needs).
- Cloud-provider integrations beyond what the filesystem already exposes
  (iCloud/Dropbox folders work as folders; no proprietary APIs).

## 2. Architecture decisions (locked unless proven wrong)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Swift 6, strict concurrency | Native perf, actors fit the operation engine |
| File panes | AppKit `NSTableView` | 100k rows, total keyboard control; SwiftUI still weak here |
| Secondary UI | SwiftUI (settings, palette, dialogs, onboarding) | Velocity where perf doesn't matter |
| Core logic | `DirnexCore` — local SwiftPM package, zero AppKit imports | Testable headless; UI is a thin client |
| VFS | Protocol-based virtual filesystem from day one | Archives/SFTP become "just another backend"; retrofitting is painful |
| Watching | FSEvents (per-directory, coalesced) | Live panel refresh |
| Copy path | `copyfile()` with `COPYFILE_CLONE`, fall back to chunked copy with progress callbacks | Instant same-volume APFS copies |
| Delete | Trash via `NSWorkspace` by default; permanent delete behind a modifier | Safety first |
| Sandbox | None. Developer ID + notarization, distributed outside MAS | Needs Full Disk Access |
| Updates | Sparkle 2 | Standard for non-MAS apps |
| Min macOS | 14 (Sonoma) | Modern APIs, still covers the realistic user base |
| Persistence | JSON/plist for config; SQLite for frecency + undo journal | Boring and debuggable |

### Core abstractions

```
DirnexCore
├── VFS
│   ├── VFSBackend (protocol): list, stat, read, write, capabilities
│   ├── VFSPath: backend id + path within backend (composable: zip inside sftp)
│   ├── LocalBackend (M1) · ArchiveBackend (M4) · SFTPBackend (M5)
│   └── DirectoryModel: sorted/filtered snapshot a panel renders; FSEvents-driven
├── Operations
│   ├── Operation (copy/move/delete/rename/pack): source set → destination
│   ├── OperationQueue actor: serial-per-volume scheduling, pause/resume, ETA
│   ├── ConflictPolicy: ask / overwrite / skip / keep-both / newer-only
│   └── UndoJournal: reversible record per operation (SQLite)
└── Services
    ├── Frecency store · Hotlist · History
    ├── Search (mdfind + streamed content grep)
    └── GitStatusProvider (M6)
```

**Rule:** the app target contains no file-manipulation logic. If it touches bytes,
it lives in `DirnexCore` and has tests.

## 4. Milestones

Sizes are relative (S ≈ days, M ≈ 1–2 weeks, L ≈ 3+ weeks of focused work).
Each milestone ends in something runnable; no milestone depends on a later one.

### M0 — Scaffolding (S)

Goal: empty but real project; every later PR lands on green CI.

- [x] Xcode project + `DirnexCore` SwiftPM package, Swift 6 strict concurrency
- [x] SwiftFormat/SwiftLint config; CI (GitHub Actions: build + tests on macOS runner)
- [x] Fixture generator: script that builds test directory trees (deep nesting,
      100k files, weird names: emoji, NFD/NFC unicode, 1000-char paths, symlinks)
- [x] App icon placeholder; ad-hoc signing for local/CI (Developer ID deferred to M7)

Exit: `xcodebuild test` green in CI; app launches to an empty window. ✅ met locally
(CI configured; Developer ID signing intentionally deferred to M7 per §2 "distributed
outside MAS" — ad-hoc signing runs everywhere without a team).

Notes:
- Xcode project uses file-system-synchronized groups (objectVersion 77) so no file
  generator (XcodeGen/Tuist) is needed — `git clone && xcodebuild test` just works.
- `DirnexCore` is a standalone SwiftPM package tested via `swift test`. It is wired
  into the app target as a local package dependency in M1, when the app first needs it.

### M1 — Read-only dual-pane browser (L)

Goal: the app already feels good with zero file operations. This milestone defines
the product's feel; do not rush it.

- [x] `LocalBackend` + `DirectoryModel`: list, stat, sort (name/size/date/ext), hidden-files toggle
- [x] Panel view: `NSTableView`, virtualized (view reuse + per-extension icon cache), columns:
      name, size, date; header-click sort with direction indicator. 60fps/100k budget not yet
      measured — deferred to the M1 exit gate / M7 perf pass.
- [x] Two panels + splitter; active-panel highlight; Tab switches
- [x] Keyboard core: arrows/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown, Enter (open dir / launch file),
      Cmd+Down/Up, and type-to-filter with live narrowing. Backspace is filter-aware (trims
      the filter, else goes up); Esc clears filter then marks (via `cancelOperation:`).
- [x] Selection model: Space/Insert toggle-and-advance, Cmd+A (mark all), `*` invert,
      `+`/`-` glob select, and Space-on-directory in-place recursive sizing.
- [x] Tabs per panel: new (Cmd+T)/close (Cmd+W)/switch (Cmd+Shift+[ / ])/drag-reorder,
      restored on relaunch. Tab bar auto-hides at a single tab.
- [x] Path bar: clickable breadcrumbs, Cmd+L to edit as text with completion
- [x] Volumes/places strip (replaces TC's drive letters); eject
- [x] FSEvents: panels refresh live, preserving cursor and selection
- [x] Quick Look on Cmd+Y (Space stays reserved for selection, per §7); previews the marked
      set or the cursor file, tracks the cursor live
- [x] Drag out to other apps; drag in = reveal only (real drop lands in M2)
- [x] Sort/column state per tab, persisted. Per-tab **sort** (key + direction) and per-tab
      **column widths/order** both live in each tab and persist across launches — switching
      tabs swaps the shared table's column geometry in/out.

_Shipped over 11 passes (2026-07-05 → 07-06). Per-pass detail (files, design rationale, gotchas) lives in git history and the memory topic file._

Exit: can live in it for browsing all day; 100k-dir opens < 150 ms warm; scroll never
drops frames; unicode/symlink fixtures render correctly.

### M2 — Operation engine (L)

Goal: TC's killer feature — queued, non-blocking, undoable file operations.

- [x] `Operation` model ✅ + `OperationQueue` actor ✅: concurrent across volume pairs,
      serial per volume pair (no disk thrashing); pause/resume, cancel, aggregate
      progress + ETA — landed as `FileOperationQueue` (renamed only to dodge
      `Foundation.OperationQueue`) and now **wired into the app** (F5/F6 route through it,
      window-bottom queue bar). "Add to queue" vs "run now" as an explicit choice is a
      later nicety — everything runs through the queue today
- [x] Copy (F5): APFS clone fast path; chunked fallback with per-file + total progress;
      preserves xattrs, permissions, dates, Finder tags; throughput/ETA readout ✅ (queue bar)
- [x] Move (F6): rename fast path same-volume; copy+delete across volumes
- [x] Delete (F8): to Trash; Shift+F8 permanent with explicit confirm
- [x] New folder (F7) ✅, inline rename (F2) ✅ — Enter-on-name deferred (Enter opens
      the cursor entry in the TC key model, so F2 is the rename trigger)
- [x] Progress UI: the window-bottom **queue bar** ✅ — aggregate determinate progress +
      live throughput + ETA, current-item label, pause/resume + cancel-all buttons,
      non-blocking (replaced the modal progress sheet, now deleted) — plus an **expandable
      per-job list** ✅ (disclosure chevron → one scrollable row per queued copy/move, each
      with its own progress bar + cancel button)
- [x] Conflict engine: ask/overwrite/skip/keep-both ✅ + newer-only ✅; **rich per-file
      dialog** ✅ (side-by-side thumbnails + size + date, newer item flagged) with **"apply
      to all"** ✅ — the engine now yields per conflict (`ConflictPolicy.ask` +
      `resolveConflict` callback). Full side-by-side text diff still deferred (thumbnails
      already give images a preview and text files a content peek)
- [x] Undo journal: Cmd+Z reverses move/rename/copy/new-folder + delete-to-Trash restore ✅;
      journal survives relaunch (JSON in UserDefaults) ✅; overwrites marked non-reversible and
      surfaced ✅ — reversal logic + property tests in `DirnexCore/…/UndoJournal.swift`
- [x] Errors: failures collected + summarized ✅; **per-file skip/retry/abort** ✅ — the engine
      yields per failed source (`CopyEngine.run(onError:)` → `ErrorResolution` skip/retry/abort),
      bridged to a main-actor `ErrorDialog` by `ErrorPrompter` ("apply to all" = skip-all)
- [x] Drop onto panel = real copy/move through the queue ✅ (pane-to-pane, into a
      subfolder, or from Finder; Finder's copy-vs-move conventions; routed through the
      shared queue via the same `submitTransfer` as F5/F6)
- [x] Core test suite on fixtures: cancellation mid-copy ✅, conflicts ✅, cross-volume ✅,
      symlink ✅, permission errors ✅, disk-full ✅, source-changed-during-copy ✅

_Shipped over 12 passes (2026-07-06 → 07-07); 130+ core tests. Per-pass detail lives in git history and the memory topic file._

Exit: 50 GB copy runs in background while browsing stays 60fps; yanking a USB drive
mid-copy produces a sane error, not a hang; Cmd+Z after a bad move actually fixes it.

### M3 — Discoverability layer (M)

Goal: fix TC's adoption problem — nobody should need the manual.

- [x] Cmd+K command palette: fuzzy search over every action, shows shortcuts,
      recents on top; palette actions and menu bar generated from one action registry ✅
- [x] Directory hotlist (Ctrl+D): pin, reorder, jump ✅
- [x] Per-panel history (Alt+Down list; Cmd+[ / Cmd+] back/forward) ✅
- [x] Frecency jump: visit tracking; path bar accepts fuzzy fragments
      ("dl" → ~/Downloads), zoxide-style scoring ✅ (JSON store; SQLite deferred like undo)
- [x] Workspaces: save/restore both panels with all tabs, named, switchable from palette ✅
      (JSON store; per-workspace palette entries deferred — surfaced via the "Workspaces…" popup)
- [x] Settings window (SwiftUI): general, panels, operations, shortcuts ✅
- [x] Rebindable shortcuts with conflict detection; TC-compatible preset and macOS preset ✅

_Shipped over 6 passes (2026-07-08). Per-pass detail lives in git history and the memory topic file._

Exit: a new user can discover copy/move/hotlist through the palette alone; power user
can rebind everything. ✅ met — palette (pass 1) + a full rebind UI with conflict detection
and two presets.

### M4 — VFS payoff (L)

Goal: cash in the VFS abstraction from M0.

- [x] `ArchiveBackend`: **browse zip/tar/tgz/7z as folders ✅**, **F5 copy-out ✅**, **Quick Look /
      Quick View inside ✅**, **pack via ⌥F5 ✅**, **nested archives (browse/extract a zip inside a
      zip) ✅** (via `bsdtar`, not libarchive — the C-module gate stays deferred)
- [x] Archive writes: **delete inside zip via F8 ✅ + add-into via paste ⌘V / F5 / F6 ✅**
      (extract → edit the tree → repack → atomic swap; rewrite strategy, journal-safe temp file)
- [x] Multi-rename tool: pattern tokens ([N] name, [C] counter, [E] ext, date tokens),
      regex find/replace, case transforms, live preview table, applies as one undoable batch
- [x] Search (Alt+F7 / palette): mdfind-backed name+content search with filter chips
      (kind, size, date ✅ — tag chip + content-grep fallback for non-indexed volumes deferred)
- [x] Search results → virtual panel listing: normal cursor/selection/F5 on results
- [x] Quick view panel (⌃Q toggle — Cmd+Q quits, Cmd+Shift+Q was free but ⌃Q is the TC key):
      inactive panel becomes live Quick Look/text preview of the file under cursor
- [x] Saved searches as virtual folders in the places strip ✅ — name a results panel via
      Go ▸ Save Search… (⌘S when a results tab is active), it lands in the sidebar's
      **Searches** section (magnifier icon); click to re-run into a fresh results tab;
      right-click → Run / Rename… / Delete

Exit: open a zip, fish two files out, repack — no temp-folder dance; rename 500 photos
by date pattern and undo it; search feeds a panel.

_Shipped over 11 passes (2026-07-09 → 07-12); 341 core tests. Per-pass detail (ArchiveBackend rewrite strategy, nested-archive mapping, saved searches, recurring gotchas) lives in git history and the memory topic file._

### M5 — Network and sync (M)

- [ ] `SFTPBackend` (swift-nio-ssh or libssh2): connection manager, keychain-stored
      credentials, key auth; browse/copy through the standard queue with resume
- [ ] Capability degradation: panels grey out unsupported ops per backend (no Trash on
      SFTP → explicit delete confirm; no clone → always chunked)
- [x] Synchronize directories: two-panel diff view (left-only / right-only / differs /
      same ✅), by size+date or content ✅; selective sync actions through the queue ✅;
      per-row *direction override* ✅ (right-click a row → flip a copy the other way, or turn a
      copy into a delete; also resolves a bidirectional `differ` conflict by hand) — include/
      exclude per row already done
- [~] Compare by content: **byte compare ✅** (`ByteComparator`, drives sync `.content` mode);
      FileMerge/Kaleidoscope/BBEdit external-diff handoff still TODO

Exit: mirror a local folder to a server over SFTP, verify with sync-dirs, all queued
and pausable.

Progress (2026-07-12, M5 pass 1): the **directory-synchronization comparison core** landed —
the tested, headless *comparison* half of the "Synchronize directories" item (its two-panel
diff-view UI + queue wiring is the next pass; boxes stay `[ ]` until that lands). Picked first
because it's pure Swift and slots straight into the core→app rhythm, whereas `SFTPBackend` needs
a swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 dependency + a live server to test against — the M5 infra gate, analogous
to M4's libarchive gate. Two new `DirnexCore/Services/` files, no changes to existing APIs:
- **`DirectorySync.swift`** — `DirectorySync.compare(left:right:leftBackend:rightBackend:
  comparison:tolerance:includingIdentical:isCancelled:contentsEqual:)` walks both trees in
  lock-step (iterative explicit-stack over a private `DirectoryPair{left,right,prefix}`, like
  `DirectorySizer`, so deep trees can't blow the call stack) and returns one `SyncEntry`
  (`relativePath`+`name`+`left:FileEntry?`+`right:FileEntry?`+`status`, `Identifiable` by
  relative path) per differing/one-sided item, **sorted by relativePath** (deterministic
  regardless of traversal order → stable tests + stable UI). `SyncStatus` = `leftOnly /
  rightOnly / leftNewer / rightNewer / differ / identical / typeMismatch`. Design decisions:
  (1) directories present on **both** sides are descended into but emit **no row** (rows =
  actionable file diffs + one-sided items); a directory on **only one** side is a **single**
  non-recursed subtree row (the app copies/deletes it wholesale, matching TC's collapsed
  folder row). (2) `SyncComparison.sizeAndDate` (size equal AND |Δmtime| ≤ `tolerance`,
  default **2 s** for FAT/exFAT coarseness, TC's value) vs `.content` (exact bytes; short-
  circuits on size mismatch, falls back to size+date for symlinks/specials). (3) content
  equality is an **injected** `contentsEqual` closure (default `ByteComparator.localFilesEqual`)
  so the engine needs no read-primitive on `VFSBackend` and tests drive content mode with a
  fake. (4) **SAFETY: a listing failure propagates** — an unreadable dir throws rather than
  reading as empty, because silently doing so could delete the other side's matching files in
  a mirror (contrast `DirectorySizer`, which *does* swallow — there a partial number is fine;
  here a partial listing is dangerous). `defaultAction(for:direction:)` derives the pre-checked
  per-row action for `SyncDirection.leftToRight / rightToLeft / bidirectional` → `SyncAction`
  (`none / copyToRight / copyToLeft / deleteLeft / deleteRight / conflict`): a mirror is
  authoritative (overwrites even a newer destination + prunes destination-only items),
  bidirectional unions + newer-wins + never deletes + flags `differ`/`typeMismatch` as
  `conflict`; a file-vs-dir `typeMismatch` is **always** `conflict` in every direction (the
  strict-and-safe stance from MultiRename — never auto-delete a whole dir to drop a file in).
- **`ByteComparator.swift`** — knocks out the byte-compare half of the "Compare by content"
  item: `ByteComparator.localFilesEqual(_:_:chunkSize:isCancelled:)` chunk-compares two local
  regular files (128 KB chunks, never loads whole files), short-circuits `false` on a size
  mismatch without reading, `true` on same-path/two-empties; throws `.unsupported` for a
  non-`.local` path (network read arrives with `SFTPBackend`) or a directory, and normalizes
  read failures to `VFSError` via a POSIX-errno recovery helper. (External-diff-tool handoff —
  FileMerge/Kaleidoscope/BBEdit — is the remaining slice of that item, an app-layer pass.)
+18 `DirectorySync` +9 `ByteComparator` tests → **368 core tests** (was 341). Whole thing
`swift test` green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean; app target untouched (new files only,
no existing-API changes, so no rebuild needed). GOTCHA hit: swiftlint `large_tuple` (>2 members)
on the work-stack `(left,right,prefix)` triple → extracted the private `DirectoryPair` struct.
NEXT M5: the sync-dirs UI (two-panel diff view driven by `compare`, per-row action override,
apply through the M2 `FileOperationQueue`); then the SFTPBackend infra gate; capability
degradation; external-diff handoff.

Progress (2026-07-12, M5 pass 2): the **Synchronize Directories UI** landed — the diff-view +
apply half of the sync item (**that box now `[x]`**; byte-compare `[~]`). One new headless
command + three app files, wiring the pass-1 `DirectorySync` engine into a real sheet that
reconciles the two panes through the M2 queue. VERIFIED LIVE end-to-end (no overlay this
session, so fully mouse-driven). Pieces:
- **Command** (core): `CommandCatalog` gains `file.syncDirectories` ("Synchronize Directories…",
  `.file`, **no shortcut** → conflict-free; new `coversSyncDirectories` test → **369 core
  tests**). Wired app-side in `CommandBinding` (→ `synchronizeDirectories(_:)`) and
  `MainMenuBuilder` (File menu, right after Pack). GOTCHA: adding one command tipped the
  `CommandCatalog` main-enum body over swiftlint `type_body_length` 250 → moved the `workspace`
  array into the existing bottom extension (where window/application already live).
- **`SyncDirectoriesController.swift`** — the sheet (modeled on `MultiRenameController`,
  `presentAsSheet`-retained). A **Direction** segmented control (Left→Right / Both Directions /
  Right→Left) and a **Compare by** control (Size & Date / Content) over a diff `NSTableView`:
  columns *include-checkbox · Item (relativePath, "/"-suffixed for dirs) · leftFolder detail ·
  action glyph · rightFolder detail*. Action column = green →/← for a copy, red ✕ for a delete
  (which side is clear from the populated detail column), ⚠ for a conflict, each with a tooltip.
  A **direction change re-derives actions in memory** (`recomputeActions`, instant); a
  **comparison change re-runs `DirectorySync.compare` off-main** (content mode reads bytes) with
  a spinner. Footer reads "N to copy, M to delete · K conflicts skipped"; empty result →
  "The folders are already in sync." with Synchronize disabled. Conflicts render with a disabled
  checkbox (no safe action). GOTCHAS (swiftlint, both recurring): `large_tuple` on the columns
  array / `row(at:)` / `actionDisplay` → replaced with an `addColumn` helper, returning the
  `fileprivate` `Row` struct, and an `ActionStyle` struct; `type_body_length` on the class →
  moved the four `make*` view-builders into a same-file `private extension` (extensions don't
  count toward the type body). NOTE: `Row` had to be `fileprivate` (not `private`) because the
  `fileprivate row(at:)` accessor returns it.
- **`PanelViewController+Sync.swift`** — entry point + apply. `synchronizeDirectories(_:)`
  casts `host as? BrowserWindowController` to always use the **physical** left/right panes (so
  the direction controls match the on-screen layout regardless of focus), gates on two distinct
  real local folders (`canSynchronize`, also the `validateMenuItem` case), and presents the
  sheet. On commit: **copies are batched by destination directory** (multiple sources → one
  `FileOperation`) and enqueued under `.overwrite` (the user already decided in the diff — no
  per-file prompt; atomic temp-swap keeps the original safe), so the window's queue drives
  progress/undo exactly like F5; **deletes go to the Trash** off-main as one pass, journaled via
  `UndoRecord.trash`. A **delete count triggers a confirm sheet** first ("… will move N items to
  the Trash"). The relative path's parent always exists on the destination side (the engine only
  descends into both-sides dirs), so a nested copy's target directory is guaranteed present.
LIVE TEST (seeded both panes onto fixture trees via the `Dirnex.tabs.<side>` UserDefaults JSON):
the sheet listed exactly the 6 differences (identical `same.txt` correctly omitted) with
"5 to copy, 1 to delete"; Right→Left flipped every row (3 copy ←, 3 delete ✕, "3 to copy, 3 to
delete"); Content mode rescanned to the same 6; Synchronize (Left→Right) raised the delete
confirm, then on disk overwrote `changed.txt` with the newer left copy, copied `only_left.txt` +
the nested `sub/leftonly_nested.txt`, overwrote the nested `sub/nested.txt`, **recursively copied
the one-sided `leftdir/deep/x.txt` subtree**, and trashed `only_right.txt`; a re-scan then
reported "already in sync" (metadata preserved → idempotent). App `xcodebuild` + `swift test`
green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. NEXT M5: per-row direction override (flip one row);
the `SFTPBackend` infra gate (swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 + live server); capability degradation;
external-diff-tool handoff.

Progress (2026-07-12, M5 pass 3): **per-row direction override** — the one deferred niceness on
the sync item, **now `[x]`**. Right-click any diff row to override its action against the global
direction: flip a copy the other way, or turn a copy into a delete; a bidirectional `differ`
conflict (or a mirror row you disagree with) is resolved by hand this way. Two-part, core→app as
always:
- **Core** (pure, tested): `DirectorySync.availableActions(for status:) -> [SyncAction]` (+ a
  `SyncEntry.availableActions` convenience) — the *actionable* choices a user may assign to one
  row: a both-sides difference (`leftNewer`/`rightNewer`/`differ`) → `[.copyToRight, .copyToLeft]`
  (copy either way, never delete a file that exists on both sides); a one-sided item → propagate
  *or* delete from its side (`leftOnly`→`[.copyToRight, .deleteLeft]`, mirror for `rightOnly`);
  `identical` and `typeMismatch` → `[]` (no safe override — a file-vs-folder clash still can't be
  auto-resolved, matching the strict stance). `.none`/`.conflict` are deliberately absent (skip is
  the checkbox's job; conflict is a non-action). +5 tests → **374 core tests** (was 369).
- **App**: `SyncDirectoriesController` gains an `NSMenu` (delegate = self) on the diff table;
  `menuNeedsUpdate` rebuilds it per-click from `tableView.clickedRow` — one item per
  `availableActions`, a `.on` checkmark on the row's current action, target `setRowAction(_:)`
  (row in `tag`, `SyncAction` in `representedObject`); an empty list shows one disabled caption
  ("One side is a folder — resolve manually"). Picking an item sets the row's action + forces
  `included = true`, reloads that row, and recomputes the footer. Added a "Right-click a row to
  change its action" hint in the controls row. A direction/comparison change still re-derives
  defaults and drops overrides (documented behavior). GOTCHA (recurring, `file_length` this time,
  not `type_body_length`): the new menu tipped the controller over swiftlint's 500-line
  `file_length` → **split the diff-table + override-menu rendering into a companion file**
  `SyncDirectoriesController+DiffTable.swift` (data source + delegate + `NSMenuDelegate` +
  `ActionStyle`). That cross-file split forced widening `Row`, `rowCount`, `row(at:)`,
  `isActionable`, `toggleInclude`, `setRowAction`, `tableView`, `leftDir`, `rightDir` from
  `private`/`fileprivate` to internal (Swift `private` doesn't cross files; a `private`
  `tableView` in a `NSTableViewDelegate`-conforming type even resolves to the delegate *method* in
  the other file → "has no member 'clickedRow'" until widened). App `xcodebuild` (into `build/`
  via `-derivedDataPath build`, since the default DerivedData copy isn't the one LaunchServices
  launches) + `swift test` green, swiftformat/swiftlint-strict clean. VERIFIED LIVE end-to-end:
  seeded two fixture trees (`changed.txt` left-newer, `only_left.txt`, `only_right.txt`, identical
  `same.txt`); right-click `changed.txt` showed "✓ Copy to R / Copy to L" → picked Copy to L (glyph
  → ←); right-click `only_left.txt` showed "✓ Copy to R / Delete from L" → picked Delete from L
  (footer went "2 to copy, 1 to delete" → "1 to copy, 2 to delete"); Synchronize raised the
  **2-item** trash confirm (proving the overridden delete count drives it), and on disk `L/changed.txt`
  became the *right* copy (6 B "right", i.e. copied **leftward** per the override, NOT the L→R
  default's 34 B), `only_left.txt` was trashed from L (not copied to R), `only_right.txt` trashed
  from R — both panes refreshed to identical `changed.txt`+`same.txt`, no crash. NEXT M5: the
  `SFTPBackend` infra gate (swift-nio-ssh/libssh2 + live server); capability degradation;
  external-diff-tool handoff (FileMerge/Kaleidoscope/BBEdit — the remaining `[~]` slice).

### M6 — Mac-native power features (M)

- [ ] Git awareness: branch in path bar, status column (M/A/?/ignored) via a debounced
      `git status --porcelain` provider; optional .gitignore-aware folder sizes
- [ ] Finder tags: column, edit from panel, filter chips in search
- [ ] Terminal drawer: bottom pane following active panel's cwd; "cd sync back" via
      shell integration snippet; open in iTerm/Terminal/WezTerm as alternative
- [ ] Size visualization mode: toggle panel to ncdu-style bars, computed async, cached
- [ ] Share sheet, "Open With" submenu, Services integration
- [ ] Automation: AppleScript/Shortcuts verbs (reveal, copy, run-op); user actions —
      shell scripts receiving selection as argv/env, surfaced in palette and F-key bar
- [ ] iCloud/provider sync-status column (NSFileManager ubiquity attrs where available)

Exit: git repo browsing shows live status; a user-defined "convert to webp" script on
selection runs from the palette.

### M7 — Release readiness (M)

- [ ] Sparkle 2 updates + appcast infrastructure; notarized DMG pipeline in CI
- [ ] Full Disk Access onboarding flow (detect, explain, deep-link to System Settings)
- [ ] First-run tour: palette-centric, 5 screens max
- [ ] Performance pass: instruments audit of M1 budgets on real dirty data
      (huge Downloads, node_modules, network volumes, iCloud placeholder files)
- [ ] Crash reporting (opt-in) + anonymized op-failure telemetry decision
- [ ] Docs site: keyboard reference generated from the action registry
- [ ] Private beta → public beta → 1.0

Exit: a stranger can download, pass FDA onboarding, and move files in under 3 minutes.

## 5. Cross-cutting: testing strategy

| Layer | Approach |
|---|---|
| DirnexCore | Unit tests against generated fixtures; every operation tested for: success, cancel mid-flight, permission denied, disk full, source mutated during op |
| VFS backends | One shared conformance test suite run against every backend (Local, Archive, SFTP-against-docker) |
| Undo journal | Property tests: op + undo == original tree (compare via content hash) |
| Panels/keyboard | XCUITest smoke for the keyboard core; snapshot tests for panel rendering states |
| Performance | XCTest metrics gated in CI: 100k-dir list < 150 ms, filter keystroke < 16 ms, memory ceiling on huge dirs |

## 6. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| SwiftUI temptation for panels degrades perf later | Decision locked in §2; perf budgets in CI make regressions loud |
| Undo journal correctness (the scariest feature) | Property tests from M2 day one; non-reversible ops explicitly marked in UI, never silently dropped |
| FSEvents refresh fighting the cursor/selection | DirectoryModel diffs snapshots and reapplies cursor by identity, not row index; test with high-churn fixture |
| Archive writes corrupting user data | Always rewrite to temp + atomic swap; never in-place |
| Full Disk Access friction kills onboarding | Dedicated flow in M7; app degrades gracefully (browse home dir) before grant |
| Scope creep before the feel is right | M1 exit criteria are the gate; nothing from M3+ starts until M1 feels great |

## 7. Open questions (decide by end of M1)

- Space key: TC uses it for select+dir-size, macOS muscle memory says Quick Look.
  Current plan: Space = select/size (TC), Cmd+Y and a palette action = Quick Look.
  Validate with real use in M1.
- Quick view panel shortcut (Ctrl+Q vs Cmd+Shift+Q) — Cmd+Q is untouchable.
- Tabs UI: native-style segmented tabs vs compact TC-style. Prototype both in M1.
- Name/brand check for "Dirnex" before public beta (M7).
