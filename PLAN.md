# Dirnex — implementation plan

A dual-pane, keyboard-first file manager for macOS in the spirit of Total Commander,
built native (Swift), with macOS-only superpowers TC never had: Quick Look, Spotlight
search, APFS clones, Finder tags, a command palette, and universal undo.

Status: M0–M11 shipped · M12 (localization) in progress · Created: 2026-07-05 · Log: [docs/HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md)

## 1. Product goals

**Must be true at 1.0:**

- Fully operable without a mouse. Tab switches panels, typing filters, F-keys drive
  operations, selection is independent of the cursor.
- File operations never block the UI. Everything runs through a background queue with
  progress, pause/resume, and conflict resolution.
- Feels native: Quick Look, Trash, drag-and-drop, dark mode, Finder tags, share sheet.
- Fast on ugly inputs: a 100k-entry directory opens and scrolls without jank.
- Undo works for file operations, not just text fields.

**Non-goals (for 1.0):**

- Windows/Linux ports.
- App Store distribution (sandbox is incompatible with a real file manager).
- An open binary plugin API (revisit post-1.0; automation hooks cover most needs).
- Cloud-provider integrations beyond what the filesystem already exposes
  (iCloud/Dropbox folders work as folders; no proprietary APIs).

## 2. Architecture decisions (locked unless proven wrong)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Swift 6, strict concurrency | Native perf, actors fit the operation engine |
| File panes | AppKit `NSTableView` | 100k rows, total keyboard control; SwiftUI still weak here |
| Secondary UI | SwiftUI (settings, palette, dialogs, onboarding) | Velocity where perf doesn't matter |
| Core logic | `DirnexCore` — local SwiftPM package, zero AppKit imports | Testable headless; UI is a thin client |
| VFS | Protocol-based virtual filesystem from day one | Archives/SFTP become "just another backend"; retrofitting is painful |
| Watching | FSEvents (per-directory, coalesced) | Live panel refresh |
| Copy path | `copyfile()` with `COPYFILE_CLONE`, fall back to chunked copy with progress callbacks | Instant same-volume APFS copies |
| Delete | Trash via `NSWorkspace` by default; permanent delete behind a modifier | Safety first |
| Sandbox | None. Developer ID + notarization, distributed outside MAS | Needs Full Disk Access |
| Updates | Sparkle 2 | Standard for non-MAS apps |
| Min macOS | 14 (Sonoma) | Modern APIs, still covers the realistic user base |
| Persistence | JSON/plist for config; SQLite for frecency + undo journal | Boring and debuggable |

### Core abstractions

```
DirnexCore
├── VFS
│   ├── VFSBackend (protocol): list, stat, read, write, capabilities
│   ├── VFSPath: backend id + path within backend (composable: zip inside sftp)
│   ├── LocalBackend (M1) · ArchiveBackend (M4) · SFTPBackend (M5)
│   └── DirectoryModel: sorted/filtered snapshot a panel renders; FSEvents-driven
├── Operations
│   ├── Operation (copy/move/delete/rename/pack): source set → destination
│   ├── OperationQueue actor: serial-per-volume scheduling, pause/resume, ETA
│   ├── ConflictPolicy: ask / overwrite / skip / keep-both / newer-only
│   └── UndoJournal: reversible record per operation (SQLite)
└── Services
    ├── Frecency store · Favorites · History
    ├── Search (mdfind + streamed content grep)
    └── GitStatusProvider (M6)
```

**Rule:** the app target contains no file-manipulation logic. If it touches bytes,
it lives in `DirnexCore` and has tests.

## 4. Milestones

Sizes are relative (S ≈ days, M ≈ 1–2 weeks, L ≈ 3+ weeks of focused work).
Each milestone ends in something runnable; no milestone depends on a later one.

### Shipped: M0 → M11 (2026-07-05 → 2026-07-22)

Eleven milestones, all closed. The checklists and the full per-pass progress log —
what was probed, decided, and rejected — live in
**[docs/HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md)**; source comments citing `PLAN.md §M5` and the like
refer to those sections.

| | Milestone | Landed | Left deliberately undone |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Scaffolding | 07-05 | — |
| M1 | Read-only dual-pane browser | 07-06 | — |
| M2 | Operation engine | 07-07 | Side-by-side text diff in the conflict dialog |
| M3 | Discoverability layer | 07-08 | SQLite stores (JSON is fine); per-workspace palette entries |
| M4 | VFS payoff | 07-12 | libarchive C-module gate (`bsdtar` instead); search tag chip + content-grep fallback |
| M5 | Network and sync | 07-14 | — |
| M6 | Mac-native power features | 07-19 | — |
| M7 | Release readiness | 07-19 | — |
| M8 | The sidebar as a first-class surface | 07-21 | Dragging a *remote* (SFTP) folder into the sidebar — stays menu-only; Recents ordered by modification date, not the true last-used stamp |
| M9 | iCloud Drive, for real | 07-21 | Per-item download percentage (macOS exposes none through the URL resource keys); Put Back inside the iCloud trash — the origin is an opaque provider reference with no path in it |
| M10 | Google Drive and Docs | 07-22 | A real Drive API backend (OAuth + Drive v3, native Docs export/import) — dropped 2026-07-22; sync status in Drive's *mirror* mode, which macOS exposes to no one but Finder |
| M11 | F4 Edit, and Quick View at full size | 07-22 | A built-in text editor (F4 hands the file to the user's own); write-back for archive and SFTP files (edit-temp-watch-repack is its own slice); a slideshow timer or thumbnail filmstrip in the preview |

The undone column is scope that was decided against, not forgotten — each one is argued in
its HISTORY.md entry. The newest such call is the **built-in text editor** (2026-07-22): a
real one is encoding detection, line-ending preservation, a binary gate, undo grouping and
find/replace — a whole app, and every Mac already has one the user has already chosen, so F4
hands the file over the way ⌥F3 hands two files to FileMerge. Revisit only if leaving the app
proves to break the keyboard-first flow, which is a claim to test by living with the handoff
first. The call before it was the **Drive API backend** (2026-07-22): the Desktop mount reaches
every Drive account that is actually on this Mac, and going past it would have bought a second,
worse path to the same files at the price of an OAuth flow, a restricted-scope verification and
a paid annual security assessment. It also lines up with §1's standing non-goal — cloud folders
are folders, no proprietary APIs.

M8 also closed with one deliberate deviation from its own exit criterion: **the Trash is a
merged listing, not a location** — macOS keeps one trash per volume, so the one sidebar row
that cannot be a directory browses like a *results* pane rather than like a folder. M9 closed
with a second: **"what Finder's iCloud Drive shows" is matched approximately, on purpose** —
which app containers Finder lists is not derivable from anything public, so Dirnex's rule is
declared public scope and a folder that exists. Both are argued in HISTORY.md. The *direction* of
that approximation was reversed on 2026-07-21 (see M10): it used to also require a
non-empty folder, which hid three folders Finder shows.

### In progress: M12 — Localization (started 2026-07-22)

Eight languages eventually; English is the source and Russian is the first translation, added
alongside the machinery so the machinery is proven by a real language rather than by a
pseudolanguage. No RTL in the planned set — CJK is, so input-method behaviour in the inline rename
field and the palette needs a live check when those land.

**Pass 1 — plumbing (2026-07-22, landed).** Auto-selection from the system language, an in-app
override, and every string the *registry* owns translated end to end.

- `DirnexCore` gains `AppLanguage`/`AppLanguages` (shipped languages, endonyms, and the pure
  system-preference matching) and `LocalizationKey` (the key scheme). **The core still ships no
  resources**: its English `title`/`label`/`keywords` stay data and act as the fallback, so
  `swift test` remains hermetic and no catalog test asserts against translated output.
  `Command.id` is the translation key — which is what its doc comment already promised.
- The app owns `Localizable.xcstrings`. `LocalizedCatalog` joins the registry to it and is the only
  entry point the app uses, so every downstream `command.title` is translated without each display
  site having to remember. Translated palette keywords are **added** to the English ones.
- Language switching writes `AppleLanguages` into Dirnex's own defaults domain and relaunches —
  which carries AppKit's own strings and Sparkle's dialogs along with ours. Settings ▸ General has
  the picker and a "Relaunch" button; `.system` is the absence of a pin, so auto-selection is free.
- Hand-rolled `count == 1 ? … : …` plurals became catalog plural variants, two of them through
  `substitutions` (Russian needs one/few/many, and needs to reorder the sentence).
- Verified live: menu bar, palette, function bar, Settings and the relaunch round trip, all in
  Russian, with the session restored intact across the restart. Two bugs only the live run found —
  the menu bar's titles were a second hardcoded copy of the category names, and `Text("a" + "b")`
  silently bypasses localization. Both in NOTES.md.

**Pass 2 — the extraction sweep (next).** ~500–700 remaining AppKit and SwiftUI literals wrapped
file by file so Xcode extracts them, then Russian filled in. Mechanical; the lever that makes it
verifiable is Xcode's **pseudolanguages** — accented catches literals that were never wrapped,
double-length catches truncation in the function bar and column headers before a translator is
involved. Worth a lint rule keeping bare literals out of UI files afterwards.

**Pass 3 — the remaining six languages.** Adding one is a line in `AppLanguages.all` plus its
column in the catalog; `LocalizationCoverageTests` fails until the column is complete.

Deliberately excluded: the AppleScript `.sdef` terminology, since scripting vocabulary is
conventionally English and translating it breaks users' scripts. App Intents phrases are localizable
but are their own pass.

## 5. Cross-cutting: testing strategy

| Layer | Approach |
|---|---|
| DirnexCore | Unit tests against generated fixtures; every operation tested for: success, cancel mid-flight, permission denied, disk full, source mutated during op |
| VFS backends | One shared conformance test suite run against every backend (Local, Archive, SFTP-against-docker) |
| Undo journal | Property tests: op + undo == original tree (compare via content hash) |
| Panels/keyboard | XCUITest smoke for the keyboard core; snapshot tests for panel rendering states |
| Performance | XCTest metrics gated in CI: 100k-dir list < 150 ms, filter keystroke < 16 ms, memory ceiling on huge dirs |

## 6. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| SwiftUI temptation for panels degrades perf later | Decision locked in §2; perf budgets in CI make regressions loud |
| Undo journal correctness (the scariest feature) | Property tests from M2 day one; non-reversible ops explicitly marked in UI, never silently dropped |
| FSEvents refresh fighting the cursor/selection | DirectoryModel diffs snapshots and reapplies cursor by identity, not row index; test with high-churn fixture |
| Archive writes corrupting user data | Always rewrite to temp + atomic swap; never in-place |
| Full Disk Access friction kills onboarding | Dedicated flow in M7; app degrades gracefully (browse home dir) before grant |
| Scope creep before the feel is right | M1 exit criteria are the gate; nothing from M3+ starts until M1 feels great |

## 7. Open questions

All four opened before M1 are closed — the first three by shipping and living in the result,
which was the stated way to decide them. Recorded because reopening one is a real design
change, not a free choice:

- **Space key** — TC's select+dir-size won over macOS's Quick Look. ⌘Y and a palette action
  carry Quick Look. Validated by use across M1–M8.
- **Quick view panel shortcut** — ⌃Q. ⌘Q is untouchable and ⌘⇧Q was free but less TC-like.
- **Tabs UI** — compact TC-style, auto-hiding at a single tab.
- **Name/brand check for "Dirnex"** — resolved 2026-07-19: the name is free, cleared by the
  user, no conflicting prior marks. The `NOTICE` / `TRADEMARKS.md` carve-out stands as written.

Opened and closed during M8:

- **Seeding an existing favorites** — resolved 2026-07-20: **standard places lead, existing pins
  follow.** The sidebar therefore looks unchanged on the launch after the merge, which matters more
  than the one thing it costs: a path pinned under a custom label ("Dl" for Downloads) is reclaimed
  as the standard row and loses that label. The alternatives were pins-first (nothing the user chose
  moves, but the sidebar's top rows change on update) and seeding fresh installs only (honest about
  ownership, but Home/Desktop/Documents visibly vanish on update). Still needs a one-shot "seeded"
  flag in `FavoritesStore`, so it is a real migration and not a first-run branch.

Opened and closed during M10:

- **Google OAuth scope for a Drive API backend** — resolved 2026-07-22 by **not needing one.** The
  fork was `drive`/`drive.readonly` (restricted: browse the *whole* Drive, but Google requires
  restricted-scope verification **plus a paid annual CASA third-party security assessment** before a
  distributed build may use it) versus `drive.file` (unrestricted, no assessment, but limited to files
  the app itself created or the user explicitly picked — which cannot list a pre-existing Drive and so
  is useless for a file manager). Dropping the API backend drops the question with it: the Desktop
  mount browses through `LocalBackend` with no OAuth, no scope and no assessment. Reopening it means
  taking on the whole verification commitment, which is why it stays written down.
